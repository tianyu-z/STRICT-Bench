    "text": "Ceftriaxone, sold under the brand name Rocephin, is a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic used for the treatment of a number of bacterial infections. These include middle ear infections, endocarditis, meningitis, pneumonia, bone and joint infections, intra-abdominal infections, skin infections, urinary tract infections, gonorrhea, and pelvic inflammatory disease. It is also sometimes used before surgery and following a bite wound to try to prevent infection. Ceftriaxone can be given by injection into a vein or into a muscle.  Common side effects include pain at the site of injection and allergic reactions. Other possible side effects include C. difficile-associated diarrhea, hemolytic anemia, gall bladder disease, and seizures. It is not recommended in those who have had anaphylaxis to penicillin but may be used in those who have had milder reactions. The intravenous form should not be given with intravenous calcium. There is tentative evidence that ceftriaxone is relatively safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding. It is a third-generation cephalosporin that works by preventing bacteria from making a cell wall.  Ceftriaxone was patented in 1978 and approved for medical use in 1982. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication.  Medical use   Ceftriaxone and other third-generation cephalosporin antibiotics are used to treat organisms that tend to be resistant to many other antibiotics. Due to emergent resistance, ceftriaxone should not be used for the treatment of Enterobacter infections. Before using ceftriaxone, it is important to determine the susceptibility of the bacteria. If sepsis is being considered, empiric therapy may be initiated prior to susceptibility testing.  Medical uses include:  lower respiratory tract infections  acute bacterial otitis media  skin and skin structure infections  urinary tract infections  uncomplicated gonorrhea  pelvic inflammatory disease  bacterial sepsis  intra-abdominal infections  meningitis  surgical prophylaxis  Lyme disease  Ceftriaxone is also a choice drug for treatment of bacterial meningitis caused by pneumococci, meningococci, Haemophilus influenzae, and \"susceptible enteric Gram-negative rods, but not Listeria monocytogenes.\"  In combination with doxycycline or azithromycin, ceftriaxone used to be recommended by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for the treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhea. Due to increased risk of developing azithromycin resistant strains and the high efficacy of higher doses of ceftriaxone the guidance has been updated to mono-antibiotic therapy with a higher dose of ceftriaxone.  Spectrum of activity  Like other third-generation cephalosporins, ceftriaxone is active against Citrobacter spp., Serratia marcescens, and beta-lactamase-producing strains of Haemophilus and Neisseria. However, unlike ceftazidime and cefoperazone, ceftriaxone does not have useful activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It is generally not active against Enterobacter species, and its use should be avoided in the treatment of Enterobacter infections, even if the isolate appears susceptible, because of the emergence of resistance. Some organisms, such as Citrobacter, Providencia, and Serratia, have the ability to become resistant through the development of cephalosporinases (enzymes that hydrolyze cephalosporins and render them inactive). Although not being used as first line therapy against Staphylococcus aures, ceftriaxone retains activity against isolates of methicillin-resistant S. aureus and is used in clinic for infections sustained by this bacterium. In this case the dose should be doubled (e.g. 2 g intravenously every 12 hours).  Available forms  Ceftriaxone is available for administration via the intramuscular or the intravenous routes. Diluents containing calcium should not be used to reconstitute ceftriaxone, and it must not be administered in intravenous lines containing other calcium-containing solutions, as a ceftriaxone-calcium precipitate could form.  Specific populations  Pregnancy  Ceftriaxone is pregnancy category B. It has not been observed to cause birth defects in animal studies, but a lack of well-controlled studies done in pregnant women exists.  Breastfeeding  Low concentrations of ceftriaxone are excreted in breast milk that are \"not expected to cause adverse effects in breastfed infants.\" The manufacturer recommends that caution be exercised when administering ceftriaxone to women who breastfeed.  Newborns  Hyperbilirubinemic neonates are contraindicated for the use of ceftriaxone. It can compete with bilirubin and displace it from binding to albumin, increasing the risk of bilirubin encephalopathy.  Elderly  According to the package insert, clinical studies did not show differences in efficacy and safety of ceftriaxone in geriatrics compared to younger patients but \"greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.\"  Adverse effects   Although generally well tolerated, the most common adverse reactions associated with ceftriaxone are changes in white blood cell counts, local reactions at site of administration, rash, and diarrhea.  Incidence of adverse effects greater than 1%:  Eosinophilia (6%)  Thrombocytosis (5.1%)  Elevations in liver enzymes (3.1–3.3%)  Diarrhea (2.7%)  Leukopenia (2.1%)  Elevation in BUN (1.2%)  Local reactions: pain, tenderness, irritation (1%)  Rash (1.7%)  Some less frequently reported adverse events (incidence < 1%) include phlebitis, itchiness, fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, elevations of bilirubin, elevations in creatinine, headache and dizziness.  Ceftriaxone may precipitate in bile, causing biliary sludge, biliary pseudolithiasis, and gallstones, especially in children. Hypoprothrombinaemia and bleeding are specific side effects. Haemolysis is reported. It has also been reported to cause post kidney failure in children. Like other antibiotics, ceftriaxone use can result in Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea ranging from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. In this regard it has been reported that shifting from ceftriaxone to cefotaxime would have a lower impact on C. difficile infection rates, since cefotaxime is almost entirely excreted by the kidneys  while ceftriaxone has a 45% biliary excretion  Contraindications  Ceftriaxone should not be used in those with an allergy to ceftriaxone or any component of the formulation. Although there is negligible cross-reactivity between penicillins and third-generation cephalosporins, caution should still be used when using ceftriaxone in penicillin-sensitive patients. Caution should be used in people who have had previous severe penicillin allergies. It should not be used in hyperbilirubinemic neonates, particularly those who are premature because ceftriaxone is reported to displace bilirubin from albumin binding sites, potentially causing bilirubin encephalopathy. Concomitant use with intravenous calcium-containing solutions/products in neonates (≤28 days) is contraindicated  even if administered through different infusion lines due to rare fatal cases of calcium-ceftriaxone precipitations in neonatal lungs and kidneys.  Mechanism of action  Ceftriaxone is a third-generation antibiotic from the cephalosporin family of antibiotics.  It is within the β-lactam family of antibiotics. Ceftriaxone selectively and irreversibly inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to transpeptidases, also called transamidases, which are penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) that catalyze the cross-linking of the peptidoglycan polymers forming the bacterial cell wall. The peptidoglycan cell wall is made up of pentapeptide units attached to a polysaccharide backbone with alternating units of N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetylmuramic acid. PBPs act on a terminal D-alanyl-D-alanine moiety on a pentapeptide unit and catalyze the formation of a peptide bond between the penultimate D-alanine and a glycine unit on an adjacent peptidoglycan strand, releasing the terminal D-alanine unit in the process. The structure of ceftriaxone mimics the D-alanyl-D-alanine moiety, and the PBP attacks the beta-lactam ring in ceftriaxone as if it were its normal D-alanyl-D-alanine substrate. The peptidoglycan cross-linking activity of PBPs is a construction and repair mechanism that normally helps to maintain bacterial cell wall integrity, so the inhibition of PBPs leads to damage and destruction of the cell wall and eventually to cell lysis.  Pharmacokinetics  Absorption: Ceftriaxone can be administered intravenously and intramuscularly, and the drug is completely absorbed. It is not available orally.  Distribution: Ceftriaxone penetrates tissues and body fluids well, including cerebrospinal fluid to treat central nervous system infections. Ceftriaxone is reversibly bound to human plasma proteins and the binding of ceftriaxone decreases with increasing concentration from a value of 95% at plasma concentrations less than 25 mcg/mL to 85% at plasma concentration of 300 mcg/mL. Over a 0.15 to 3 g dose range in healthy adult subjects, the apparent volume of distribution ranged from 5.8 to 13.5 L.  Metabolism: 33–67% of ceftriaxone is renally excreted as unchanged drug, but no dose adjustments are required in renal impairment with dosages up to 2 grams per day. The rest is excreted in the bile as unchanged drug which is ultimately excreted in feces as inactive compounds from hepatic and gut flora metabolism.  Elimination: The average elimination half-life in healthy adults is 5.8–8.7 (mean 6.5) hours, with some reviews estimated half-life up to 10 hours. In people with renal impairment, the average elimination half-life increases to 11.4–15.7 hours.  Chemistry   Ceftriaxone is commercially available as a white to yellowish-orange crystalline powder for reconstitution. Reconstituted ceftriaxone injection solutions are light yellow- to amber-colored depending on how long the solution had been reconstituted, the concentration of ceftriaxone in the solution, and the diluent used. To reduce pain with intramuscular injections, ceftriaxone may be reconstituted with lidocaine.  The syn-configuration of the methoxy oxime moiety confers resistance to beta-lactamase enzymes produced by many Gram-negative bacteria. The stability of this configuration results in increased activity of ceftriaxone against otherwise resistant Gram-negative bacteria. In place of the easily hydrolyzed acetyl group of cefotaxime, ceftriaxone has a metabolically stable  moiety.  Research  Ceftriaxone has also been investigated for efficacy in preventing relapse to cocaine addiction.  Ceftriaxone seems to increase excitatory amino acid transporter-2 pump expression and activity in the central nervous system, so has a potential to reduce glutamatergic toxicity.  Ceftriaxone has been shown to have neuroprotective properties in a number of neurological disorders, including spinal muscular atrophy and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Despite earlier negative results in the 1990s, a large clinical trial was undertaken in 2006 to test ceftriaxone in ALS patients, but was  stopped early after it became clear that the results would not meet the predetermined criteria for efficacy.

    "text": "Gray molasses is a method of sub-Doppler laser cooling of atoms. It employs principles from Sisyphus cooling in conjunction with a so-called \"dark\" state whose transition to the excited state is not addressed by the resonant lasers. Ultracold atomic physics experiments on atomic species with poorly-resolved hyperfine structure, like isotopes of lithium and potassium, often utilize gray molasses instead of Sisyphus cooling as a secondary cooling stage after the ubiquitous magneto-optical trap (MOT) to achieve temperatures below the Doppler limit. Unlike a MOT, which combines a molasses force with a confining force, a gray molasses can only slow but not trap atoms; hence, its efficacy as a cooling mechanism lasts only milliseconds before further cooling and trapping stages must be employed.  Overview  Like Sisyphus cooling, the cooling mechanism of gray molasses relies on a two-photon Raman-type transition between two hyperfine-split ground states mediated by an excited state. Orthogonal superpositions of these ground states constitute \"bright\" and \"dark\" states, so called since the former couples to the excited state via dipole transitions driven by the laser, and the latter is only accessible via spontaneous emission from the excited state. As neither are eigenstates of the kinetic energy operator, the dark state also evolves into the bright state with frequency proportional to the atom's external momentum. Gradients in the polarization of the molasses beam create a sinusoidal potential energy landscape for the bright state in which atoms lose kinetic energy by traveling \"uphill\" to potential energy maxima that coincide with circular polarizations capable of executing electric dipole transitions to the excited state. Atoms in the excited state are then optically pumped to the dark state and subsequently evolve back to the bright state to restart the cycle. Alternately, the pair of bright and dark ground states can be generated by electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT).  The net effect of many cycles from bright to excited to dark states is to subject atoms to Sisyphus-like cooling in the bright state and select the coldest atoms to enter the dark state and escape the cycle. The latter process constitutes velocity-selective coherent population trapping (VSCPT). The combination of bright and dark states thus inspires the name \"gray molasses.\"  History In 1988, The NIST group in Washington led by William Phillips first measured temperatures below the Doppler limit in sodium atoms in an optical molasses, prompting the search for the theoretical underpinnings of sub-Doppler cooling. The next year, Jean Dalibard and Claude Cohen-Tannoudji identified the cause as the multi-photon process of Sisyphus cooling, and Steven Chu's group likewise modeled sub-Doppler cooling as fundamentally an optical pumping scheme. As a result of their efforts, Phillips, Cohen-Tannoudji, and Chu jointly won the 1997 Nobel Prize in Physics. T.W. Hänsch, et al., first outlined the theoretical formulation of gray molasses in 1994, and a four-beam experimental realization in cesium was achieved by G. Grynberg the next year. It has since been regularly used to cool all the other alkali (hydrogenic) metals.  Comparison to Sisyphus Cooling  In Sisyphus cooling, the two hyperfine ground states of  experience equal and opposite AC Stark shifts from the near-resonant counter-propagating beams. The beams also effect a polarization gradient, alternating between linear and circular polarizations. The potential energy maxima of one  coincide with pure circular polarization, which optically pumps atoms to the other  , which experiences its minima in the same location. Over time, the atoms expend their kinetic energy traversing the potential energy landscape and transferring the potential energy difference between the crests and troughs of the AC-Stark-shifted ground state levels to emitted photons.  In contrast, gray molasses only has one sinusoidally light-shifted ground state; optical pumping at the peaks of this potential energy landscape takes atoms to the dark state, which can selectively evolve to the bright state and re-enter the cycle with sufficient momentum. Sisyphus cooling is difficult to implement when the excited state manifold is poorly-resolved (i.e. whose hyperfine spacing is comparable to or less than the constituent linewidths); in these atomic species, the Raman-type gray molasses is preferable.  Theory  Dressed-State Picture  Denote the two ground states and the excited state of the electron  and , respectively. The atom also has overall momentum, so the overall state of the atom is a product state of its internal state and its momentum, as shown in the figure. In the presence of counter-propagating beams of opposite polarization, the internal states experience the atom-light interaction Hamiltonian  where  is the Rabi frequency, approximated to be the same for both transitions. Using the definition of the translation operator in momentum space,  the effect of  on the state  is  This suggests the dressed state  that couples to  is a more convenient basis state of the two ground states. The orthogonal basis state  defined below does not couple to  at all.  The action of  on these states is  Thus,  and  undergo Sisyphus-like cooling, identifying the former as the bright state.  is optically inaccessible and constitutes the dark state. However,  and  are not eigenstates of the momentum operator, and thus motionally couple to one another via the kinetic energy term of the unperturbed Hamiltonian:  As a result of this coupling, the dark state evolves into the bright state with frequency proportional to the momentum, effectively selecting hotter atoms to re-enter the Sisyphus cooling cycle. This nonadiabatic coupling occurs predominantly at the potential minima of the light-shifted coupling state. Over time, atoms cool until they lack the momentum to traverse the sinusoidal light shift of the bright state and instead populate the dark state.  Raman Condition The resonance condition of any -type Raman process requires that the difference in the two photon energies match the difference in energy between the states at the \"legs\" of the , here the ground states  identified above. In experimental settings, this condition is realized when the detunings of the cycling and repumper frequencies in respect to the  and  transition frequencies, respectively, are equal.  Unlike most Doppler cooling techniques, light in the gray molasses must be blue-detuned from its resonant transition; the resulting Doppler heating is offset by polarization-gradient cooling. Qualitatively, this is because the choice of  means that the AC Stark shifts of the three levels are the same sign at any given position. Selecting the potential energy maxima as the sites of optical pumping to the dark state requires the overall light to be blue-detuned; in doing so, the atoms in the bright state traverse the maximum potential energy difference and thus dissipate the most kinetic energy. A full quantitative explanation of the molasses force with respect to detuning can be found in Hänsch's paper.

GAZ refers to the Sobol as a minivan.  History  At the end of 1998 GAZ based the Sobol on the Gazelle (class LCV -MC), GAZ shortened the GaZelle to a 2760 mm wheelbase, gave it a spring independent front suspension and a pent-tire rear axle, and designed it for a smaller capacity (up to 900 kg).  The family includes all-metal wagon GAZ-2752 and minibuses GAZ-2217 and GAZ-22171 (\"Barguzine\"), as well as flatbed truck (chassis cab) GAZ-2310. The basic model is GAZ-2752 van with a sliding side door and rear hinged (useful volume of  3-seater and  in 7-seater cargo-\"Combi\").  Minibus GAZ-22171 with high roof (similar height \"Gazelle\" GAZ-3221) in the 6 and 10-seat versions. Since 1999 began production of the model 2217 \"Sable Barguzine\" with \"low\" roof (height reduced by 100 mm), lift gate back door, positioned by the manufacturer as a minivan. For business purposes and taxis designed 10-seat modification of GAZ-22173 with a more dense layout and simplified trim (available on request).  In the family of \"Sable\" and provided GAZ-23107/27527/22177/221717 all-wheel-drive version with rigid front axle and universal joints (joints Gukka) to drive forward driving and steering wheels. Transmission is made with permanent four-wheel drive transfer case with a chain driven mnogozvenchatoy Morse.  In early 2003 the family \"Sobol\" has undergone restyling, a similar family of \"Gazelle\" with the redesign of feathers and replacing the rectangular headlights on modern headlight unit teardrop shape, as well as the replacement of the instrument panel and so on.  In the 2006 assembly of the truck, \"Sobol\" GAZ-2310, before that produces only small quantities, was translated into a string of conveyor with side \"Gazelle\" GAZ-3302, significantly increasing the production of this model in demand, particularly in Moscow, because of restrictions on entry into the city center car carrying capacity of 1.0 tons.  In February 2010, GAZ began production restyling of the \"Sobol-Business\" family with a package of upgraded components and assemblies, the same family of \" Business Gazelle \".  Since the end of 2010 \"Sable-Business\" also received a turbo Cummins ISF 2.8, since July 2010, is set to \"Business Gazelle\". Production of models lined the sample in 2003 and partially modernized units called \"Sable-Standard\" are stored only on a limited basis for modification of special purpose, certified for law enforcement agencies of the Russian Federation.  Lineup  GAZ-2217 - minivan, \"Sobol Barguzine\" at 7 or 11 seats, with a low roof and lift gate back door;  GAZ-22177 - minivan, \"Sobol Barguzine\" 4x4;  GAZ-22171 - minibus \"Sobol\" M1 and M2 for 7 or 11 seats with standard roof (1.5m) and hinged rear swing doors;  GAZ-221712 - Ambulance with low roof  GAZ-221717 - minibus \"Sobol\" M1 and M2 4x4  GAZ-2310 - flatbed truck (4x2) carrying capacity of 0.9 tons, the option - chassis cab for the installation of add-ons such as wagon-box;  GAZ-23107 - flatbed truck with 4x4 wheel drive transmission;  GAZ-2752 - panelvan carrying capacity of 0.8 tonnes with a sliding side door and rear double-doors, Option al combi for 7 persons with isolated cargo compartment;  GAZ-27527 - panelvan wagon 4x4 variant - optional combi with 7 seats;  Engines  On vehicles of the family \"Sobol\", as in \"Gazelle\", initially (until 2006) used the following engines:  petrol engine family ZMZ-402 (working volume of 2.5 L, 8 valves),   Petrol engine ZMZ-406.3 (working volume 2.3 L, 16 valves) and   fuel-injected gasoline engine ZMZ-406 (2.3 L, 16 valves) with a capacity of 100-110 PS, and   available on request: GAZ-560 diesel (2.1 liter), 85 PS.

    "text": "In varietate concordia () is the official motto of the European Union (EU), adopted in 2000. Its translations in the other 24 official languages of the EU have equal standing. It is inspired by its Latin-language version coined by the Italian Nobel prize winner Ernesto Teodoro Moneta: In varietate concordia or In varietate unitas, which is also used as a compromise. It is one of the newest symbols of the European Union, alongside the European flag and anthem but, unlike most, it is specific to the EU rather than originating from the Council of Europe.  According to the European Commission, \"The motto means that, via the EU, Europeans are united in working together for peace and prosperity, and that the many different cultures, traditions and languages in Europe are a positive asset for the continent.\" This amounts to the embracement of multiculturalism as the goal of European integration, as opposed to the goal of an emerging European identity which had been advocated in the 1990s.  History The European motto was first adopted in May 2000 as \"Unity in diversity\" through a non-official process since it was a contest involving 80,000 students from the 15 countries that were members of the European Union at the time (a.k.a. \"EU-15\"): Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden & United Kingdom.  La Prairie's project (1998–1999) In April 1998, French newspaper Ouest-Frances Patrick La Prairie proposed the organisation of a European mottoes contest for the, then 15, EU members' secondary education students. This event was meant as a 50-year celebration of Founding father of the European Union Robert Schuman's famous declaration about a supranational Community which eventually led to the creation of the actual European Union.  Back in 1998, the European Union had already a flag of Europe, and anthem of Europe and was about to launch the euro, its currency; it lacked a motto, hence, the contest proposal. Journalist La Prairie was in charge of Ouest-Frances Press-School mission and found two sponsors, World War II French museum Memorial de Caen and France Telecom, then a state-owned company. 40 newspaper partners were found in France as well as in the remaining countries of EU-15; with at least a newspaper per country, e.g. La Repubblica in Italy, Le Soir in Belgium, Irish Times in Ireland, Berliner Zeitung in Germany and The Guardian in UK.  The project was officially launched on 31 March 1999 with the opening of the une devise pour l'Europe contest's official website managed by France Telecom. The website featured pedagogic files, created by the operation's general Office located at the Caen Memorial, and teachers oriented pitches and registration forms available in the eleven official European languages (plus Catalan). The English-language version, called \"A motto for Europe\", had a website. The contest's slogan was \"The only prize will be to write a page of Europe's History\" (La seule récompense sera d’avoir écrit une page d’histoire de l'Europe).  A motto for Europe (1999–2000)  In September 1999, a contest was held at the start of the 1999–2000 school year to invent a motto for the European Union. 2,575 classes were involved, with students ranging from ages ten to nineteen. The main rule was that the motto had to consist of a sentence of no more than twelve words, with an accompanying explanation of no more than 1,500 characters written in the class's local language. An English version of the explanation was also required, since the teachers used this language to communicate between themselves. National and European winners were selected the following year.  By the contest deadline, 15 January 2000, 2016 mottoes had applied. A lexical analysis of this 400,000-word corpus was done by Taylor Nelson Sofres to reveal the most popular terms used by the young Europeans, which were: \"Europe\", \"peace\", \"unity\", \"union\", \"together\", \"future\", \"difference\", \"hope\", \"solidarity\", \"egality\", \"liberty\", \"diversity\", and \"respect\". This study was later used by the jury during the national selection.  In February 2000, each member of EU-15's media partner managed a top 10 national mottoes selection to later submit it to a second jury in charge of the European selection. These 142 mottoes were all translated in the 11 official European languages.  On 11 and 12 April 2000, the European Media Jury based at the Memorial of Caen, chose 7 mottoes among the late February selection (one voice per country). Those were next submitted to a final European Grand Jury in Brussels.  Proclamation at the European Parliament (2000) On 4 May 2000 almost 500 schoolchildren from fifteen classes of the EU-15 (top class of each national selection) were gathered at the European Parliament in Brussels to assist the proclamation of the motto chosen that day by the 15-member Grand Jury including former Chancellor of Austria Franz Vranitzky, former Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs Susanna Agnelli, former Belgian astronaut Dirk Frimout, former Minister of Foreign Affairs of Denmark Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, Luxembourgian historian Gilbert Trausch, former German President of the Bundestag Rita Süssmuth, Irish Senator Mary Henry, former British President of the European Commission Roy Jenkins, and former French President of the European Commission Jacques Delors.  The motto was displayed on a blue background located behind the 24th President of the European Parliament Nicole Fontaine. Unité dans la diversité, French for Unity in diversity was translated in the eleven official languages of the EU plus Latin, In varietate concordia, as read out by Fontaine. The motto had been devised by Luxembourgian youngsters and prefaced by chairman Delors who added \"Europe:\" to it. Probably by coincidence, the same motto had been used in the title of a Workshop held in the European Centre for Modern Languages (Graz) on 23–25 April 1998: \"East meets West: Unity in Diversity\". The title was chosen by Dónall Ó Riagáin, on behalf of the organizers, the European Bureau for Lesser-Used languages (EBLUL). He attributes the expression to John Hume, the leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party in Northern Ireland when he first used it, in about 1983, perhaps basing it on the text \"E pluribus unum\"’ on the Seal of the USA.  Since it had to be submitted for official approval by the fifteen Chiefs of State of the European Council at Santa Maria da Feira on 19 and 20 June 2000, President Nicole Fontaine stated: « I want it to become the motto of all institutions, just as we have a flag and anthem ».  The six rejected mottoes were \"Peace, Liberty, Solidarity\", \"Our differences are our strength\", \"United for peace and democracy\", \"United in liberty\", \"An old continent, a new hope\", and \"All different, all Europeans!\"  \"Unity in diversity\" has been the national motto of Indonesia since 1945 (Bhinneka Tunggal Eka, in ancient Javanese) and on 27 April 2000 post-apartheid South Africa adopted a similar motto (ǃke e꞉ ǀxarra ǁke) in ǀXam (a sleeping San language), which also translates in English as \"Unity in diversity\".  European Council speech (2000) On 19 June 2000, at Santa Maria da Feira, Portugal, 24th President of the European Parliament Nicole Fontaine concluded her official opening speech with the introduction of the European Union motto (Unité dans la diversité):  Since then this motto was used by several European officials during their speeches at Strasbourg, including President of European Commission Romano Prodi on 4 July 2001 « our real strength lies in \"unity in diversity\" », Italian rapporteur Giorgio Ruffolo on 4 September 2001 « Therefore, the expression 'unity in diversity' has been chosen as the motto of the report », Austrian member of the European Parliament Paul Rübig on 10 April 2002 « Europe is, after all, about unity in diversity » or Spanish Member of the European Parliament Raimon Obiols on 4 September 2003 « Yesterday the President of the European Convention ended his speech by evoking the future European motto: united in diversity ».  European Constitution (2004)  In 2004, the motto was written into the failed European Constitution's Article I-8 about the EU's symbols.  The motto translations were slightly modified since 2000, including the English-language version becoming « United in Diversity''' ». Though this constitutional treaty was eventually rejected by the French and Dutch voters on 29 May and 1 June 2005.  Europe Day (2005) On 9 May 2005, the European Commission issued promotional items such as a postcard featuring the symbols of Europe: the European flag, the European anthem, the European motto (now \"United in diversity\") and the Europe Day. Only lacked the European currency which was in the Treaty of 2004 but not yet constitutional. The official Europe Day poster also used the modified motto \"United in Diversity\".  The same day the new motto (Unie dans la diversité) was proclaimed by 1,000 youngsters at the Memorial of Caen as a 5-year celebration. These words were now written in the European Constitution project that was though rejected through referendum few days later.  Treaty of Lisbon (2007) The Treaty of Lisbon, concluded in 2007, does not contain any article dedicated to symbols of the European Union. It retained much of the 2004 treaty but omitted the articles defining the European symbols, namely the flag, anthem and motto. It does however contain a declaration by 16 member states who affirmed their recognition of the symbols. In response to the omission of the symbols from the main treaty text, the European Parliament took the avant-garde in using the symbols as it had done in adopting them in the first place. Parliament changed its internal rules to make more use of the symbols. In the case of the motto, it would be printed on all Parliamentary documents.  Official translations The first 11 official EU languages and Latin (2000) The original French motto Unité dans la diversité was translated in the other ten official EU languages plus Latin when it was proclaimed the motto for Europe on 4 May 2000.  24 official EU languages (2013) The motto was translated into the 23 languages in which there were official translations of the European Constitution on 29 October 2004. The treaty, and hence the motto, was officially translated into Bulgarian and Romanian despite the fact they would not join for a further three years. Irish was not included but is on the list here as it became an EU language in 2007. Croatian has been included since 1 July 2013.

    "text": "V (/ˈviː/, as in the letter v) also known as vlang, is a statically typed compiled programming language created by Alexander Medvednikov in early 2019. It was mostly inspired by the Go programming language, but was also influenced by C, Rust, and Oberon-2. It is free and open-source software, in active development at GitHub, and released under the MIT license.  The foremost goal of V is to be easy to use, and at the same time, to enforce a safe coding style through elimination of ambiguity. For example, variable shadowing is not allowed; declaring a variable with a name that is already used in a parent scope will cause a compilation error.  History  The new language was created as a result of frustration with existing languages being used for personal projects. Originally the language was intended for personal use, but after it was mentioned publicly and gained interest, it was decided to make it public. Initially, the name was the same as a product known as Volt. The V language was created in order to develop it, along with other software applications such as Ved (also called Vid). As the extension in use was already \".v\", to not mess up the git history, it was decided to name it \"V\". Upon public release, the compiler was written in V, and could compile itself. Along with Alexander Medvednikov, the creator, its community has a large number of contributors from around the world who have helped with continually developing and adding to the compiler, language, and modules.  Key design goals behind the creation of V: easier to learn and use, higher readability, fast compilation, increased safety, efficient development, cross-platform usability, improved C interop, better error handling, modern features, and more maintainable software.  Features  Safety   Usage of bounds checking  Usage of Option/Result   Mandatory checking of errors  No usage of values that are undefined  No shadowing of variables  No usage of null (unless in unsafe code)  No usage of global variables (unless enabled via flag)  Variables are immutable by default  Structs are immutable by default  Function args are immutable by default  Sum types can be used  Generics can be used  Performance    Fast like C (human-readable C compiled by backend)  Added features for safety, if desired, can be disabled or bypassed for greater performance  C interop  Allocations kept to minimal  Serialization with no runtime reflection  Native binaries compiled with no dependencies  Fast build   V is written in itself and can compile within a second.  Memory management options   Allocations handled by an optional GC, that is the default, which can be disabled   Manual memory management (-gc none)  Autofree (-autofree), handles most objects via free call insertion  Remaining percentage freed by GC   Arena allocation with (-prealloc)  Source code translators (code transpilation)  C source code conversion: V (via module) can translate an entire C project into V code.  Working translators (under various stages of development) exist for Go, JavaScript, and WASM.  Syntax  Hello world  fn main() { \tprintln('hello world') }  Structs   struct Point { \tx int \ty int }  mut p := Point{ \tx: 10 \ty: 20 } println(p.x) // Struct fields are accessed using a dot // Alternative literal syntax for structs with 3 fields or fewer p = Point{10, 20} assert p.x == 10  Heap structs   Structs are allocated on the stack. To allocate a struct on the heap and get a reference to it, use the & prefix: struct Point { \tx int \ty int }  p := &Point{10, 10} // References have the same syntax for accessing fields println(p.x)  Methods   V doesn't have classes, but you can define methods to types. A method is a function with a special receiver argument. The receiver appears in its own argument list between the fn keyword and the method name. Methods must be in the same module as the receiver type.  In this example, the is_registered method has a receiver of type User named u. The convention is not to use receiver names like self or this, but preferably a short name.  struct User { \tage int }  fn (u User) is_registered() bool { \treturn u.age > 16 }  user := User{ \tage: 10 } println(user.is_registered()) // \"false\" user2 := User{ \tage: 20 } println(user2.is_registered()) // \"true\"  Error handling   Optional types are for types which may represent none. Result types may represent an error returned from a function.  Option types are declared by prepending ? to the type name: ?Type. Result types use !: !Type.fn do_something(s string) !string { \tif s == 'foo' { \t\treturn 'foo' \t} \treturn error('invalid string') }  a := do_something('foo') or { 'default' } // a will be 'foo' b := do_something('bar') or { 'default' } // b will be 'default' c := do_something('bar') or { panic(\"{err}\") } // exits with error 'invalid string' and a traceback  println(a) println(b)  Vweb   import vweb  struct App {     vweb.Context }  fn main() { \tvweb.run(&App{}, 8080) } or import vweb  struct App {     vweb.Context }  fn main() { \tvweb.run_at(new_app(), vweb.RunParams{ \t    host: 'localhost' \t    port: 8099 \t    family: .ip \t}) or { panic(err) } }  ORM   V has a built-in ORM (object-relational mapping) which supports SQLite, MySQL and Postgres. Aims to also support MS SQL and Oracle.  V's ORM provides a number of benefits:   One syntax for all SQL dialects   Queries are constructed using V's syntax   Safety (queries are sanitized to prevent SQL injection)  Compile time checks (prevents typos which can only be caught during runtime)  Readability and simplicity (need not manually parse results of a query or the objects from the parsed results) import pg  struct Member { \tid         string [default: 'gen_random_uuid()'; primary; sql_type: 'uuid'] \tname       string \tcreated_at string [default: 'CURRENT_TIMESTAMP'; sql_type: 'TIMESTAMP'] }  fn main() { \tdb := pg.connect(pg.Config{ \t\thost: 'localhost' \t\tport: 5432 \t\tuser: 'user' \t\tpassword: 'password' \t\tdbname: 'dbname' \t}) or { \t\tprintln(err) \t\treturn \t}  \tdefer { \t\tdb.close() \t}  \tsql db { \t\tcreate table Member \t}!  \tnew_member := Member{ \t\tname: 'John Doe' \t}  \tsql db { \t\tinsert new_member into Member \t}!  \tselected_member := sql db { \t\tselect from Member where name == 'John Doe' limit 1 \t}!  \tsql db { \t\tupdate Member set name = 'Hitalo' where id == selected_member.id \t}! }  References  Further Reading  External links    Official website  Programming languages Cross-platform free software Cross-platform software Free compilers and interpreters Statically typed programming languages Systems programming languages Multi-paradigm programming languages Procedural programming languages Concurrent programming languages Source-to-source compilers Software using the MIT license Programming languages created in 2019 2019 software"

    "text": "An Alexanderson alternator is a rotating machine invented by Ernst Alexanderson in 1904 for the generation of high-frequency alternating current for use as a radio transmitter.  It was one of the first devices capable of generating the continuous radio waves needed for transmission of amplitude modulated signals by radio.  It was used from about 1910 in a few \"superpower\" longwave radiotelegraphy stations to transmit transoceanic message traffic by Morse code to similar stations all over the world.  Although superseded in the early 1920s by the development of vacuum-tube transmitters, the Alexanderson alternator continued to be used until World War II.  It is on the list of IEEE Milestones as a key achievement in electrical engineering.  History  Prior developments   After radio waves were discovered in 1887, the first generation of radio transmitters, the spark gap transmitters, produced strings of damped waves, pulses of radio waves which died out to zero quickly. By the 1890s it was realized that damped waves had disadvantages; their energy was spread over a broad frequency band so transmitters on different frequencies interfered with each other,  and they could not be modulated with an audio signal to transmit sound.  Efforts were made to invent transmitters that would produce continuous waves -- a sinusoidal alternating current at a single frequency.  In an 1891 lecture, Frederick Thomas Trouton pointed out that, if an electrical alternator were run at a great enough cycle speed (that is, if it turned fast enough and was built with a large enough number of magnetic poles on its armature) it would generate continuous waves at radio frequency.   Starting with Elihu Thomson in 1889, a series of researchers built high frequency alternators, Nikola Tesla (1891, 15 kHz), Salomons and Pyke (1891, 9 kHz), Parsons and Ewing (1892, 14 kHz.), Siemens (5 kHz), B. G. Lamme (1902, 10 kHz),  but none was able to reach the frequencies required for radio transmission, above 20 kHz.  Construction  In 1904, Reginald Fessenden contracted with General Electric for an alternator that generated a frequency of 100,000 hertz for continuous wave radio. The alternator was designed by Ernst Alexanderson. The Alexanderson alternator was extensively used for long-wave radio communications by shore stations, but was too large and heavy to be installed on most ships. In 1906 the first 50-kilowatt alternators were delivered. One was to Reginald Fessenden at Brant Rock, Massachusetts, another to John Hays Hammond, Jr. in Gloucester, Massachusetts and another to the  American Marconi Company in New Brunswick, New Jersey.  Alexanderson would receive a patent in 1911 for his device. The Alexanderson alternator followed Fessenden's rotary spark-gap transmitter as the second radio transmitter to be modulated to carry the human voice. Until the invention of vacuum-tube (valve) oscillators in 1913 such as the Armstrong oscillator, the Alexanderson alternator was an important high-power radio transmitter, and allowed amplitude modulation radio transmission of the human voice. The last remaining operable Alexanderson alternator is at the VLF transmitter Grimeton in Sweden and was in regular service until 1996. It continues to be operated for a few minutes on Alexanderson Day, which is either the last Sunday in June or first Sunday in July every year.  World War I and the formation of RCA   The outbreak of World War I forced European nations to temporarily abandon development of international radio communications networks, while the United States increased efforts to develop transoceanic radio. By the end of the war the Alexanderson alternator was operating to reliably provide transoceanic radio service. British Marconi offered General Electric $5,000 in business in exchange for exclusive rights to use the alternator, but just as the deal was about to go through, the American president Woodrow Wilson requested that GE decline the offer, which would have given the British (who were the leader in submarine communications cables) dominance over worldwide radio communications. GE complied with the request and joined with American Telephone and Telegraph (AT&T), the United Fruit Company, the Western Electric Company and the Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company to form the Radio Corporation of America (RCA), giving American companies control of American radio for the first time.  Stations  Thorn L. Mayes identified the production of ten pairs of 200 KW Alexanderson alternators, totaling 20 transmitters, in the period up to 1924:  U.S. military use during and after World War II   Beginning in 1941, seven of the twenty original 200 KW alternators were put into service by the U.S. Navy and Air Force:  During World War II the U.S. Navy recognized the need for reliable distant longwave (VLF) transmissions to the Pacific fleet. A new facility was constructed at Haiku in Hawaii, where two 200 KW Alexanderson alternators transferred from the mainland were installed. The Navy also operated an existing transmitter at Bolinas, California, again for Pacific ocean communication. Both Haiku alternators were sold for salvage in 1969, possibly to Kreger Company of California.   In the late 1940s the Air Force assumed control of the Haiku and Marion, Massachusetts facilities. The Air Force found that longwave transmissions were more reliable than shortwave when sending weather information to Arctic researchers as well as bases in Greenland, Labrador, and Iceland. The two Marion transmitters were used until 1957. One was scrapped in 1961 and the other was reportedly handed over to the U.S. Bureau of Standards and stored in a Smithsonian Institution warehouse.  Design   The Alexanderson alternator works similarly to an AC electric generator, but generates higher-frequency current, in the very low frequency (VLF) radio frequency range.  The rotor has no conductive windings or electrical connections; it consists of a solid disc of high tensile strength magnetic steel, with narrow slots cut in its circumference to create a series of narrow \"teeth\" that function as magnetic poles. The space between the teeth is filled with nonmagnetic material, to give the rotor a smooth surface to decrease aerodynamic drag.  The rotor is turned at a high speed by an electric motor through a speed–increaser gearbox.  The machine operates by variable reluctance (similar to an electric guitar pickup), changing the magnetic flux linking two coils.  The periphery of the rotor is embraced by a circular iron stator with a C-shaped cross-section, divided into narrow poles, the same number as the rotor has, carrying two sets of coils.  One set of coils is energized with direct current and produces a magnetic field in the air gap in the stator, which passes axially (sideways) through the rotor.  As the rotor turns, alternately either an iron section of the disk is in the gap between each pair of stator poles, allowing a high magnetic flux to cross the gap, or else a non-magnetic slot is in the stator gap, allowing less magnetic flux to pass. Thus the magnetic flux through the stator varies sinusoidally at a rapid rate. These changes in flux induce a radio-frequency voltage in a second set of coils on the stator.  The RF collector coils are all interconnected by an output transformer, whose secondary winding is connected to the antenna circuit. Modulation or telegraph keying of the radio frequency energy was done by a magnetic amplifier, which was also used for amplitude modulation and voice transmissions.  The frequency of the current generated by an Alexanderson alternator in hertz is the product of the number of rotor poles and the revolutions per second.  Higher radio frequencies thus require more poles, a higher rotational speed, or both.  Alexanderson alternators were used to produce radio waves in the very low frequency (VLF) range, for transcontinental wireless communication. A typical alternator with an output frequency of 100 kHz had 300 poles and rotated at 20,000 revolutions per minute (RPM) (333 revolutions per second).  To produce high power, the clearance between the rotor and stator had to be kept to only 1 mm.  The manufacture of precision machines rotating at such high speeds presented many new problems, and Alexanderson transmitters were bulky and very expensive.  Frequency control   The output frequency of the transmitter is proportional to the speed of the rotor.  To keep the frequency constant, the speed of the electric motor turning it was controlled with a feedback loop.  In one method, a sample of the output signal is applied to a high-Q tuned circuit, whose resonant frequency is slightly above the output frequency.  The generator's frequency falls on the \"skirt\" of the LC circuit's impedance curve, where the impedance increases rapidly with frequency.  The output of the LC circuit is rectified, and the resulting voltage is compared with a constant reference voltage to produce a feedback signal to control the motor speed.  If the output frequency gets too high, the impedance presented by the LC circuit increases, and the amplitude of the RF signal getting through the LC circuit drops.  The feedback signal to the motor drops, and the motor slows down. Thus the alternator output frequency is \"locked\" to the tuned circuit resonant frequency.  The sets were built to operate at wavelengths of 10,500 to 24,000 meters (28.57 to 12.5 KHz). This was accomplished by three design variables. The alternators were built with 1220, 976 or 772 poles. Three gearboxes were available with ratios of 2.675, 2.973 and 3.324 and the 900 RPM driving motor was operated at slips of 4% to 20%, giving speeds of 864 to 720 RPM. Transmitters installed in Europe, operating on 50-cycle power, had a wavelength range of 12,500 to 28,800 meters due to the lower speed of the driving motor.  Performance advantages   A large Alexanderson alternator might produce 500 kW of output radio-frequency energy and would be water- or oil-cooled.  One such machine had 600 pole pairs in the stator winding, and the rotor was driven at 2170 RPM, for an output frequency near 21.7 kHz. To obtain higher frequencies, higher rotor speeds were required, up to 20,000 RPM.  Along with the arc converter invented in 1903, the Alexanderson alternator was one of the first radio transmitters that generated continuous waves.  In contrast, the earlier spark-gap transmitters generated a string of damped waves.  These were electrically \"noisy\"; the energy of the transmitter was spread over a wide frequency range, so they interfered with other transmissions and operated inefficiently.  With a continuous-wave transmitter, all of the energy was concentrated within a narrow frequency band, so for a given output power they could communicate over longer distances.  In addition, continuous waves could be modulated with an audio signal to carry sound.  The Alexanderson alternator was one of the first transmitters to be used for AM transmission.  The Alexanderson alternator produced \"purer\" continuous waves than the arc converter, whose nonsinusoidal output generated significant harmonics, so the alternator was preferred for long-distance telegraphy.  Disadvantages  Because of the extremely high rotational speed compared to a conventional alternator, the Alexanderson alternator required continuous maintenance by skilled personnel. Efficient lubrication and oil or water cooling was essential for reliability which was difficult to achieve with the lubricants available at the time. In fact, early editions of the Royal Navy's \"Admiralty Handbook of Wireless Telegraphy\" cover this in considerable detail, mostly as an explanation as to why the navy did not use that particular technology. However, the US Navy did.  Other major problems were that changing the operating frequency was a lengthy and complicated process, and unlike a spark transmitter, the carrier signal could not be switched on and off at will. The latter problem greatly complicated  \"listening through\" (that is, stopping the transmission to listen for any answer). There was also the risk that it would allow enemy vessels to detect the presence of the ship.

    "text": "Royal Air Force Leiston or more simply RAF Leiston is a former Royal Air Force station located  northwest of Leiston and  south of Theberton, Suffolk, England.  History  USAAF use Originally intended as a fighter station for RAF Fighter Command, RAF Leiston airfield (actually located in Theberton) was allocated to the Eighth Air Force of the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) on 22 September 1942 and designated Station 373 (LI).  The airfield was constructed to Class A airfield standards between September 1942 and September 1943 by John Mowlem and Company Ltd. and first occupied by the USAAF in October 1943. Leiston's proximity to the coast meant that the airfield was used on many occasions by battle-damaged aircraft returning from operations over Europe. The first aircraft to land on the airfield - while it was still under construction - are believed to have been two Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses which were returning from operations on 30 July 1943. One aircraft nearly hit a contractor's vehicle when coming in to land as some of the runways were still partly obstructed by tree stumps and other materials.  The three runways were concrete overlaid with asphalt, with 62 aircraft dispersals (38 concrete pans and 12 twin pens with blast walls) situated along its perimeter track. The USAAF added 17 PSP parking squares and a walled 6-plane revetment for additional aircraft parking. Support structures included two T-2 hangars (each  in dimension) and 12 corrugated steel  wide Over Blister hangars dispersed on all sides of the perimeter track. The ten living sites located west of the airfield had a capacity for 1,709 personnel.  358th Fighter Group  The 358th Fighter Group arrived at Leiston from RAF Goxhill on 29 November 1943 after completing training. The group was assigned to the 66th Fighter Wing of the VIII Fighter Command. Aircraft of the group were identified by yellow cowlings.  The group consisted of the following squadrons:   365th Fighter Squadron (CH)  366th Fighter Squadron (IA)  367th Fighter Squadron (CP)  The 358th FG began operations on 20 December 1943 and engaged in escort work until April 1944 to cover the operations of B-17/Consolidated B-24 Liberator bombers that the USAAF sent against targets on the Continent. On 31 January 1944 the group relocated to RAF Raydon near Ipswich and became part of the Ninth Air Force, which in turn transferred the North American P-51 Mustang-equipped 357th Fighter Group from Raydon to the Eighth Air Force.  357th Fighter Group   The 357th Fighter Group, arrived at Leiston from RAF Raydon on 31 January 1944, replacing the P-47-equipped 358th Fighter Group in the 66th Fighter Wing, VIII Fighter Command. After March 1944 aircraft of the group were identified by red-yellow-red rings on the propeller spinner and a 12\" red and yellow band around the forward part of the nose in the checkerboard pattern of the 66th Fighter Wing groups.  The group consisted of the following squadrons:   362d Fighter Squadron (fuselage code G4), dispersals along the 18/36 runway (357th technical site)  363d Fighter Squadron (code B6), dispersals along the 06/24 runway (Buckles Wood)  364th Fighter Squadron (code C5), dispersals along the 13/31 runway (Moat Farm)  The 357th FG served as an escort group, providing penetration, target, and withdrawal support for bombers that attacked strategic objectives on the Continent and began operations in the assault against the German Air Force and aircraft industry during Big Week, 20–25 February 1944.  The group received a Distinguished Unit Citation for two escort missions in which heavy opposition was encountered from enemy fighters: on 6 March 1944 provided target and withdrawal support during the first attack that heavy bombers of Eighth AF made on Berlin. On 29 June 1944 the group protected bombers that struck targets at Leipzig. The unit received second DUC for operations on 14 January 1945 when the group, covering 3rd Division B-17's on a raid to synthetic oil plants at Derben broke up an attack by a large force of interceptors and in the ensuing aerial battle destroyed 56.5 German fighters (later credited as 55.5), the largest number of claims by any Eighth Air Force group on a single mission.  In addition to escort the 357th conducted counter-air patrols, made fighter sweeps, and flew strafing and dive-bombing missions in which it attacked airfields, marshalling yards, locomotives, bridges, barges, tugboats, highways, vehicles, fuel dumps, and other targets. It participated in the invasion of Normandy in June 1944, the breakthrough at Saint-Lô in July, the Battle of the Bulge, December 1944–January 1945, and the airborne assault across the Rhine in March 1945.  The group flew its last mission, an escort operation, on 25 April 1945 and moved to Neubiberg, Germany on 21 July and was assigned to United States Air Forces in Europe for duty with the army of occupation.  357th FG aces Chuck Yeager (the man who broke the sound barrier) and Bud Anderson were stationed in Leiston.  Cpt. James Browning, an ace assigned to the 363rd FS, was also stationed here until his death over the Fulda Gap in 1945.  Postwar use After the Americans departed for occupation duty, Leiston was returned to the RAF on 10 October 1945 and until 1953 it was known as No. 18 Recruit Centre, Technical Training Command. With the closure of the recruit centre Leiston was placed into care and maintenance status, then closed for good in 1955. Parts of the airfield were sold during the late 1950s and 60s, with the last pieces being returned to the public in 1965.  Current use Today Leiston airfield is virtually unrecognisable. The airfield area itself, has largely been returned to agriculture except for the Cakes & Ale Park, about 1/3 of the main runway and a short section of perimeter track further down Harrow Lane. The NW runway still exists in its full length but has been reduced to a width of about  and cannot be viewed from public roads.  A few old buildings still exist on the airfield and also on a domestic site but most are overgrown with vegetation and are in poor condition.

    "text": "Stephan A. Grupp is an American pediatric oncologist. He is the Chief of the Cell Therapy and Transplant Section in the Division of Oncology and Director of the Cancer Immunotherapy Program at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and Professor of Pediatrics at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. In 2019, Grupp was elected a Member of the National Academy of Medicine.  He has led groundbreaking clinical trials of an innovative T-cell therapy for children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Grupp has developed the first highly effective childhood cancer immunotherapy and delivered CAR T-cell therapy to the first pediatric patient in the world.  Early life and education Grupp was born to German immigrant parents, both physicians, in the United States. He earned his Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Cincinnati and his PhD in Immunology and medical degree from the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine. Following this, Grupp completed his Clinical Fellowship in Pediatrics at Harvard Medical School (Boston Children's Hospital) and his Clinical Fellowship in Pediatric Hematology/Oncology at the Dana-Farber/Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center.  Career Upon completing his formal education, Grupp accepted a faculty position at Harvard Medical School until 1996 when he joined the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP).  In 2017, Grupp was named chief of the section of cellular therapy and transplant within the division of oncology at CHOP. While serving in this role, Grupp was honored as a Citizen Diplomat from the Citizen Diplomacy International for having \"traveled throughout the world to teach doctors in other countries about using this therapy to treat children and young adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.\"  Grupp was recognized by the National Academy of Medicine for \"pioneering the development of an entirely novel therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and leading the first global engineered cell therapy trial that demonstrated effective sustained ALL remissions, making him a leader in cancer immunotherapy.\" In the same year, he was also recognized by his alma mater with the Daniel Drake Award \"for outstanding achievements in biomedical science as evidenced by major significant contributions to medical research or for a distinguished career as a clinician-teacher.\" During the COVID-19 pandemic, Grupp collaborated with various researchers on \"MIS-C different from severe COVID-19 in children.\" The study found that Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children is a post-infectious syndrome distinct from Kawasaki disease and may help guide treatment decisions.  T-cell therapy At CHOP, Grupp has led groundbreaking clinical trials of an innovative T-cell therapy for children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Pre clinical work began in the early 2000s, in addition to the first trials in activated T cell therapy. Clinical development in children began in 2011 when he received a $100,000 grant to continue his investigations on clinical trials for pediatric cancer research. With this grant money, along with substantial funding from the Pennsylvania Department of Health, he began Phase 1 of the CART19 trial to study an innovative clinical trial that programs the immune system to attack blood cancers. The small number of children with B cell cancers would undergo have their T cells modified to attack specific types of cancer in their B cells. In 2012, he performed the first pediatric CAR T-cell trial for acute lymphoblastic leukemia at CHOP and delivered CAR T-cell therapy to the first pediatric patient in the world. He conducted the experimental T-cell therapy for advanced B-cell leukemias and lymphomas on seven year old Emily Whitehead, the first pediatric patient in the trial. After attempting to use CTL019 therapy to treat her cancer, Whitehead became critically ill and was admitted to the intensive care unit. As a result, working with a team off scientists, Grupp injected her with a medication used to block the IL-6 receptor (tocilizumab) to treat this post-infusion illness (Cytokine release syndrome) which rapidly resolved her condition.  Following the successful treatment of Whitehead, Grupp and his research team published their findings on two pediatric patients who had a complete remission of cancer following this treatment. As a result of his medical achievements, Grupp was chosen by John M. Maris, director of the Center for Childhood Cancer Research at CHOP, to serve on the research team for his project \"Immunogenomics to Create New Therapies for High-Risk Childhood Cancers.\" He continued to work on personalized cellular therapy and in 2014, published findings that showed 90% of children and adults with ALL who had relapsed multiple times or failed to respond to standard therapies went into remission after receiving an investigational personalized cellular therapy (CTL019). In recognition of his work, Grupp was the co-recipient of the Pennsylvania Bio’s Patient Impact Award and Frank A. Oski Lectureship from the American Society of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology.  In 2016, Grupp collaborated with colleagues in the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania on their research study \"CAR T Cell Therapy in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia and Potential for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.\" In the study, they used immunotherapy to modify a patient’s own immune T cells. The scientists reported on the first global, multicenter clinical trial of these cells and on a separate single-center trial, the first to use a version of these cells carrying a “humanized” protein more similar to human proteins. In recognition of his efforts, Grupp won 2016 Scientist of the Year from Philly Geek Awards.  Following this, Grupp was the lead investigator of the Phase 2 trial regarding chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy which genetically modifies a patient’s immune cells to make them seek out and kill leukemia cells. After Grupp oversaw five years of clinical trials, the Food and Drug Administration approved the use of CAR-T therapy for the treatment of relapsed or refractory pediatric and young adult patients with B-cell ALL.

    "text": "Francisco Vicente Aguilera was a Cuban patriot born in Bayamo, Cuba on June 23, 1821. He had ten children with his wife Ana Manuela Maria Dolores Sebastiana Kindelan y Sanchez. He studied at the University of Havana receiving the degree of Bachelor of Laws.  Aguilera had inherited a fortune from his father, and in 1867 he was the richest landowner in the eastern region of Cuba, owning extensive properties, sugar refineries, livestock, and slaves. He never bought any of the slaves that were regularly brought from the African coast and offered for sale. He only used the slaves he had inherited from his father. This required him to hire many free workers to plant and harvest the sugarcane and work the farms. He was mayor of Bayamo, and he was a freemason and the head of the Masonic lodge in Bayamo.  He traveled to many countries, including the U.S., France, England, and Italy. On his travels he came into contact with governments that had chiefs of state who were not monarchs, leading him to embrace the progressive ideas to which he was exposed. He became an idealist who was always preoccupied with improving the conditions of his countrymen.  Youth and family  His parents were distinguished and wealthy people. Man already, eager to know and living the true democracy, of which he was a fervent lover, traveled through the United States. Back in Bayamo, he found his father had died. He received an immense fortune, everything seemed to smile at him.  In 1848 he married Miss Ana Kindelán y Griñán in Santiago. With her he had ten children. For him, family was one of his main charms. That is why he quite enjoyed taking his daughters to parties and social activities.  The richest man in the East  He owned five hundred slaves and owned rustic farms in Bayamo, Jiguaní, Las Tunas and Manzanillo in which there were several mills and vast areas dedicated to agricultural cultivation and to the raising of Livestock of very diverse type. Their urban estates were not minor. In Bayamo, he owned the city theater, two multi-story houses, many other smaller houses and a grocery store. In Manzanillo, several other houses and a warehouse for honey.  Conspiracies and uprising  In 1851 he participated in the conspiracy of Joaquín de Agüero, nevertheless, shortly after due to lack of coordination and his mother's illness momentarily he backed off from such activities. Aguilera headed the first Cuban Revolutionary Committee, founded in Bayamo, with the participation of Pedro Figueredo (Perucho) and Francisco Maceo Osorio. He directed the meeting that took place in San Miguel de Rompe, on August 3, 1868, without reaching an agreement on the date of the uprising.  In the next meetings it was agreed to postpone it until the end of the harvest season, in order to ensure the necessary resources. Soon after, the persistence of many conspirators led them to meet at the Rosario mill, on which Aguilera did not attend and therefore Carlos Manuel de Céspedes took the lead of the meeting who settled in the Manzanillo area, enjoyed a great hierarchy. From that meeting came the determination to take up arms on October 14, 1868.  The unrest of the conspirators allowed the Spanish authorities to learn about the plans for uprising. They sent groups to arrest the main leaders of the movement. For that reason, Céspedes brought forth the date of operation. He started the fight in the early morning of October 10 at his sugar mill, La Demajagua; while Aguilera, the man who started the movement did not seem to go to war so soon, he was in his Cabaniguán farm. Aguilera had someone who came to him with the news and the intention to persuade him to disavow Carlos Manuel de Céspedes. He agreed, however, with the rest of the members of the Revolutionary Committee and, through Pedro Figueredo, he communicated to Céspedes whom he supported the insurrection.  Guáimaro Assembly and government positions   On April 10, 1869, when the Assembly of Guáimaro was held, Aguilera was not present due to illness. Even the rumor of his death was circulating, for which he was not appointed to any position in the leadership of the government. When Céspedes returned to Bayamo region, he found him alive and appointed him to Secretary of War. Until the beginning of 1870 he held that responsibility and on February 24 of that year the House of Representatives created the position of Vice President of the Republic designating him for the same. A few days later, on March 8, Céspedes appointed him Lugarteniente General of the State of Oriente. He had been awarded the rank of major general before.  Emigration  Céspedes knowing the difficulties that existed abroad to seek help for the Republic of Cuba in Arms and sure of the sympathy that Aguilera enjoyed everywhere, he thought that he could influence the Cuban emigration and political figures from the United States and other countries in order to make future expeditions to Cuba with war material urged by the Cuban forces. On July 27, 1871, together with Ramón de Céspedes, he went on that mission. On the 28th he was in Jamaica and from there he left, as soon as he could, for New York, to take care of the General Agency, the body that directed foreign support for the war. On August 17 he took possession of it.  Aguilera would not take long, to his regret, to collide with the harsh reality. The United States did not recognize the Republic of Cuba in Arms. The situation was getting worse, because the Cubans that Aguilera found in the United States they were divided by interests more personal than patriotic. Some around the reformist Miguel Aldama and others around Manuel de Quesada.  Stay in Europe  In all this year Aguilera did not agree to return to Cuba. He wanted to return to the country with a great expedition that carried many weapons to Cuba and had gone through all possibilities. In 1872 he went to Europe for this purpose. He had faith that the Cubans there would not be so divided looking for their own profits and would go for the Cuban cause.  In 1873 he was back in New York. Soon after, the Chamber deposed President Céspedes. When Aguilera was the vice president, the president of the Chamber, Salvador Cisneros Betancourt, who was acting as the President of the Republic in Arms, wrote to Francisco Vicente Aguilera: \"(...) great advantages will be for the country if a man who has not spared sacrifices for his own freedom returns to it (...) You are in a better situation to administer the Republic, come and we will save the Revolution.\"  Aguilera responded to the President of the Chamber that yes, he would come to Cuba, but when he could lead a strong expedition to the West: \"Orient and Camagüey, cradle and guarantee of the Revolution,\" Aguilera told Cisneros, \"are the base of our operations, now the victory is in the West (...) we can kill Spanish soldiers in the East, but the way to conclude the war is to dry up the source from which they spring and we know where that source is.\"  Insurrectionist  At the time, Spain remained in control of Cuba, but had lost control of several of its territories in Central and South America in the early 19th century. This was mostly due to the efforts of Simón Bolívar, who is credited with leading the fight for independence in what are now the countries of Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Panama, and Bolivia. Colonial rule had its pros and cons. The pros being that the controlling country helped to improve the standard of living in the territory by building out infrastructure, introducing new technologies and implementing systems of governance and organization. The cons were that the controlling country exploited the people under their control with unfair labor practices and exploited the land with little or no recompense to the natives. In Cuba, the Spaniards were forcing the native Indians to work under dreadful conditions in gold mines. In Aguilera's lifetime, the cons were far outweighing the pros and he was very much in favor of the separation of Cuba from Spain.  In 1851, at the age of 30, Aguilera began to conspire against Spanish colonial rule, and joined himself with a movement begun by proto-independence patriot Joaquín de Agüero in Camagüey, Cuba. Henceforth, together with other wealthy landowners of the region, he spoke out openly against colonial Spanish rule. He led an anti-Spanish outbreak that occurred in Bayamo in 1867 and was selected as leader of a General Committee that had been designated to carry out plans for the insurrectionists. The other two members of this committee were Francisco Maceo and Pedro \"Perucho\" Figueredo, later author of the Cuban National Anthem. Aguilera actively participated in the creation of conspiratorial groups in diverse regions of the country, including the planning of preliminary reunions that culminated in the declaration of independence of October 10, 1868 at Yara, led by planter and lawyer Carlos Manuel de Cespedes. Aguilera took the position that Cespedes' revolt should wait until more money could be raised before attacking, and though his viewpoint did not prevail, he deferred total control of the insurrection and subsequent war to Cespedes, who became de facto leader of the independence movement. Aguilera's support of Cespedes stemmed from both his disinterest in political power, and his desire to improve the lot of his fellow countrymen.  Aguilera put his money where his mouth was. At one of the conspiracy meetings he famously announced that he was ready and willing to sell all his private property at market value to raise funds for arming the new Cuban Army of Independence. The following day, he published an ad in Bayamo's major newspaper offering all his properties, buildings, and livestock, which included 35,000 head of cattle and 4,000 horses, for sale.  Aguilera held many positions in the Cuban Army, including Major General, Minister of War, Vice President of the Republic, and Commander-in-Chief of the Eastern District. While in command of the army he was distinguished for courage and ability, taking part in person in many engagements and skirmishes.  Emancipation of slaves  Upon the outbreak of war in 1868, Aguilera freed all 500 of his slaves, an illegal action under the Spanish law in effect in Cuba at that time, and joined ranks with many of them to retake the city of Bayamo from the Spanish. Many of his ex-slaves became soldiers and officers in the War of Independence.  Death  In 1871, Francisco Vicente Aguilera went to New York City to raise funds for the war effort. He had given everything away for the cause of Cuban independence. Aguilera died completely destitute after a brief bout with throat cancer in his apartment at 223 West 30th Street in New York on February 22, 1877. The Cuban Republic, finally free after so many years and casualties, honored Aguilera by printing his image on the Cuban $100 peso bill (pictured above) that was in circulation prior to the 1959 communist revolution.  Mausoleum  Aguilera's remains have been kept in Bayamo since 1910. However, the history of the transfer of his remains to his homeland and the consequent burials is so rich that they are well worth another journalistic report.  His remains were taken from the San Juan cemetery so that it would not be transferred to the Santiago necropolis of Santa Ifigenia Cemetery.  In 1958, the mausoleum was inaugurated in his homage. His remains currently rest in its base.  Not far from this, monuments to other illustrious Bayamese rise, and they are collectively called Retablo de los Héroes.

    "text": "Fluoxetine, sold under the brand name Prozac, among others, is an antidepressant of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) class. It is used for the treatment of major depressive disorder, obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), bulimia nervosa, panic disorder, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder. It is also approved for treatment of major depressive disorder in adolescents and children 8 years of age and over. It has also been used to treat premature ejaculation. Fluoxetine is taken by mouth.  Common side effects include indigestion, trouble sleeping, sexual dysfunction, loss of appetite, nausea, diarrhea, dry mouth, and rash. Serious side effects include serotonin syndrome, mania, seizures, an increased risk of suicidal behavior in people under 25 years old, and an increased risk of bleeding. Antidepressant discontinuation syndrome is less likely to occur with fluoxetine than with other antidepressants, but it still happens in many cases. Fluoxetine taken during pregnancy is associated with significant increase in congenital heart defects in the newborns. It has been suggested that fluoxetine therapy may be continued during breastfeeding if it was used during pregnancy or if other antidepressants were ineffective.  Fluoxetine was discovered by Eli Lilly and Company in 1972, and entered medical use in 1986. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2020, it was the 25th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 23million prescriptions. Lilly also markets fluoxetine in a fixed-dose combination with olanzapine as olanzapine/fluoxetine (Symbyax).  Medical uses  Fluoxetine is frequently used to treat major depressive disorder, obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), bulimia nervosa, panic disorder, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, and trichotillomania. It has also been used for cataplexy, obesity, and alcohol dependence, as well as binge eating disorder. Fluoxetine seems to be ineffective for social anxiety disorder. Studies do not support a benefit in children with autism, though there is tentative evidence for its benefit in adult autism. Fluoxetine together with fluvoxamine has shown some initial promise as a potential treatment for reducing COVID-19 severity if given early.  Depression Fluoxetine is approved for the treatment of major depression in children and adults. Meta-analysis of trials in adults conclude that fluoxetine modestly outperforms placebo. Fluoxetine may be less effective than other antidepressants, but has high acceptability.  For children and adolescents with moderate-to-severe depressive disorder, fluoxetine seems to be the best treatment (either with or without cognitive behavioural therapy, although fluoxetine alone does not appear to be superior to CBT alone) but more research is needed to be certain, as effect sizes are small and the existing evidence is of dubious quality. A 2022 systematic review of the two original blinded-control trials used to approve the use of fluoxetine in children and adolescents with depression found that both of the control trials were severely flawed, and did not demonstrate the efficacy of the medication.  Obsessive–compulsive disorder Fluoxetine is effective in the treatment of obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) for adults. It is also effective for treating OCD in children and adolescents. The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry state that SSRIs, including fluoxetine, should be used as first-line therapy in children, along with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), for the treatment of moderate to severe OCD.  Panic disorder The efficacy of fluoxetine in the treatment of panic disorder was demonstrated in two 12-week randomized multicenter phase III clinical trials that enrolled patients diagnosed with panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia. In the first trial, 42% of subjects in the fluoxetine-treated arm were free of panic attacks at the end of the study, vs. 28% in the placebo arm. In the second trial, 62% of fluoxetine treated patients were free of panic attacks at the end of the study, vs. 44% in the placebo arm.  Bulimia nervosa A 2011 systematic review discussed seven trials which compared fluoxetine to a placebo in the treatment of bulimia nervosa, six of which found a statistically significant reduction in symptoms such as vomiting and binge eating. However, no difference was observed between treatment arms when fluoxetine and psychotherapy were compared to psychotherapy alone.  Premenstrual dysphoric disorder Fluoxetine is used to treat premenstrual dysphoric disorder, a condition where individuals have affective and somatic symptoms monthly during the luteal phase of menstruation. Taking fluoxetine 20 mg/d can be effective in treating PMDD, though doses of 10 mg/d have also been prescribed effectively.  Impulsive aggression Fluoxetine is considered a first-line medication for the treatment of impulsive aggression of low intensity. Fluoxetine reduced low intensity aggressive behavior in patients in intermittent aggressive disorder and borderline personality disorder. Fluoxetine also reduced acts of domestic violence in alcoholics with a history of such behavior.  Obesity and overweight adults  In 2019 a systematic review compared the effects on weight of various doses of fluoxetine (60 mg/d, 40 mg/d, 20 mg/d, 10 mg/d) in obese and overweight adults. When compared to placebo, all dosages of fluoxetine appeared to contribute to weight loss but lead to increased risk of experiencing side effects such as dizziness, drowsiness, fatigue, insomnia and nausea during period of treatment. However, these conclusions were from low certainty evidence. When comparing, in the same review, the effects of fluoxetine on weight of obese and overweight adults, to other anti-obesity agents, omega-3 gel capsule and not receiving a treatment, the authors could not reach conclusive results due to poor quality of evidence.  Special populations In children and adolescents, fluoxetine is the antidepressant of choice due to tentative evidence favoring its efficacy and tolerability. Evidence supporting an increased risk of major fetal malformations resulting from fluoxetine exposure is limited, although the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) of the United Kingdom has warned prescribers and patients of the potential for fluoxetine exposure in the first trimester (during organogenesis, formation of the fetal organs) to cause a slight increase in the risk of congenital cardiac malformations in the newborn. Furthermore, an association between fluoxetine use during the first trimester and an increased risk of minor fetal malformations was observed in one study.  However, a systematic review and meta-analysis of 21 studies – published in the Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada – concluded, \"the apparent increased risk of fetal cardiac malformations associated with maternal use of fluoxetine has recently been shown also in depressed women who deferred SSRI therapy in pregnancy, and therefore most probably reflects an ascertainment bias. Overall, women who are treated with fluoxetine during the first trimester of pregnancy do not appear to have an increased risk of major fetal malformations.\"  Per the FDA, infants exposed to SSRIs in late pregnancy may have an increased risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn. Limited data support this risk, but the FDA recommends physicians consider tapering SSRIs such as fluoxetine during the third trimester. A 2009 review recommended against fluoxetine as a first-line SSRI during lactation, stating, \"Fluoxetine should be viewed as a less-preferred SSRI for breastfeeding mothers, particularly with newborn infants, and in those mothers who consumed fluoxetine during gestation.\" Sertraline is often the preferred SSRI during pregnancy due to the relatively minimal fetal exposure observed and its safety profile while breastfeeding.  Adverse effects Side effects observed in fluoxetine-treated persons in clinical trials with an incidence >5% and at least twice as common in fluoxetine-treated persons compared to those who received a placebo pill include abnormal dreams, abnormal ejaculation, anorexia, anxiety, asthenia, diarrhea, dizziness, dry mouth, dyspepsia, fatigue, flu syndrome, impotence, insomnia, decreased libido, nausea, nervousness, pharyngitis, rash, sinusitis, somnolence, sweating, tremor, vasodilation, and yawning. Fluoxetine is considered the most stimulating of the SSRIs (that is, it is most prone to causing insomnia and agitation). It also appears to be the most prone of the SSRIs for producing dermatologic reactions (e.g. urticaria (hives), rash, itchiness, etc.).  Sexual dysfunction  Sexual dysfunction, including loss of libido, erectile dysfunction, lack of vaginal lubrication, and anorgasmia, are some of the most commonly encountered adverse effects of treatment with fluoxetine and other SSRIs. While early clinical trials suggested a relatively low rate of sexual dysfunction, more recent studies in which the investigator actively inquires about sexual problems suggest that the incidence is >70%.  In 2019, the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee of the European Medicines Agency recommended that packaging leaflets of selected SSRIs and SNRIs should be amended to include information regarding a possible risk of persistent sexual dysfunction. Following on the European assessment, a safety review by Health Canada \"could neither confirm nor rule out a causal link... which was long lasting in rare cases\", but recommended that \"healthcare professionals inform patients about the potential risk of long-lasting sexual dysfunction despite discontinuation of treatment\".  Antidepressant discontinuation syndrome Fluoxetine's longer half-life makes it less common to develop antidepressant discontinuation syndrome following cessation of therapy, especially when compared with antidepressants with shorter half-lives such as paroxetine. Although gradual dose reductions are recommended with antidepressants with shorter half-lives, tapering may not be necessary with fluoxetine.  Pregnancy  Antidepressant exposure (including fluoxetine) is associated with shorter average duration of pregnancy (by three days), increased risk of preterm delivery (by 55%), lower birth weight (by 75 g), and lower Apgar scores (by <0.4 points). There is 30–36% increase in congenital heart defects among children whose mothers were prescribed fluoxetine during pregnancy, with fluoxetine use in the first trimester associated with 38–65% increase in septal heart defects.  Suicide  In October 2004, the FDA added a black box warning to all antidepressant drugs regarding use in children. In 2006, the FDA included adults aged 25 or younger. Statistical analyses conducted by two independent groups of FDA experts found a 2-fold increase of the suicidal ideation and behavior in children and adolescents, and 1.5-fold increase of suicidality in the 18–24 age group. The suicidality was slightly decreased for those older than 24, and statistically significantly lower in the 65 and older group. This analysis was criticized by Donald Klein, who noted that suicidality, that is suicidal ideation and behavior, is not necessarily a good surrogate marker for suicide, and it is still possible, while unproven, that antidepressants may prevent actual suicide while increasing suicidality. In February 2018, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ordered an update to the warnings based on statistical evidence from twenty four trials in which the risk of such events increased from two percent to four percent relative to the placebo trials.  On 14 September 1989, Joseph T. Wesbecker killed eight people and injured twelve before committing suicide. His relatives and victims blamed his actions on the Prozac medication he had begun taking a month prior. The incident set off a chain of lawsuits and public outcries. Lawyers began using Prozac to justify the abnormal behaviors of their clients. Eli Lilly was accused of not doing enough to warn patients and doctors about the adverse effects, which it had described as \"activation\", years prior to the incident.  There is less data on fluoxetine than on antidepressants as a whole. In 2004, the FDA had to combine the results of 295 trials of 11 antidepressants for psychiatric indications to obtain statistically significant results. Considered separately, fluoxetine use in children increased the odds of suicidality by 50%, and in adults decreased the odds of suicidality by approximately 30%. A study published in May 2009 found that fluoxetine was more likely to increase overall suicidal behavior. 14.7% of the patients (n = 44) on fluoxetine had suicidal events, compared to 6.3% in the psychotherapy group and 8.4% from the combined treatment group. Similarly, the analysis conducted by the UK MHRA found a 50% increase in suicide-related events, not reaching statistical significance, in the children and adolescents on fluoxetine as compared to the ones on placebo. According to the MHRA data, fluoxetine did not change the rate of self-harm in adults and statistically significantly decreased suicidal ideation by 50%.  QT prolongation  Fluoxetine can affect the electrical currents that heart muscle cells use to coordinate their contraction, specifically the potassium currents Ito and IKs that repolarise the cardiac action potential. Under certain circumstances, this can lead to prolongation of the QT interval, a measurement made on an electrocardiogram reflecting how long it takes for the heart to electrically recharge after each heartbeat. When fluoxetine is taken alongside other drugs that prolong the QT interval, or by those with a susceptibility to long QT syndrome, there is a small risk of potentially lethal abnormal heart rhythms such as torsades de pointes. A study completed in 2011 found that fluoxetine does not alter the QT interval and has no clinically meaningful effects on the cardiac action potential.  Overdose  In overdose, most frequent adverse effects include:  Nervous system effects  anxiety  nervousness  insomnia  drowsiness  fatigue or asthenia  tremor  dizziness or lightheadedness  Gastrointestinal effects  anorexia (symptom)  nausea  diarrhea  vasodilation  dry mouth  abnormal vision  Other effects  abnormal ejaculation  rash  sweating  decreased libido  Interactions   Contraindications include prior treatment (within the past 5–6 weeks, depending on the dose) with MAOIs such as phenelzine and tranylcypromine, due to the potential for serotonin syndrome. Its use should also be avoided in those with known hypersensitivities to fluoxetine or any of the other ingredients in the formulation used. Its use in those concurrently receiving pimozide or thioridazine is also advised against.  In case of short term administration of codeine for pain management, it is advised to monitor and adjust dosage. Codeine might not provide sufficient analgesia when Fluoxetine is co-administered. If opioid treatment is required, oxycodone use should be monitored since oxycodone is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system and fluoxetine and paroxetine are potent inhibitors of CYP2D6 enzymes. This means combinations of codeine or oxycodone with fluoxetine antidepressant may lead to reduced analgesia.  In some cases, use of dextromethorphan-containing cold and cough medications with fluoxetine is advised against, due to fluoxetine increasing serotonin levels, as well as the fact that fluoxetine is a cytochrome P450 2D6 inhibitor, which causes dextromethorphan to not be metabolized at a normal rate, thus increasing the risk of serotonin syndrome and other potential side effects of dextromethorphan.  Patients who are taking NSAIDs, antiplatelet drugs, anticoagulants, omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin E, and garlic supplements must be careful when taking fluoxetine or other SSRIs, as they can sometimes increase the blood-thinning effects of these medications.  Fluoxetine and norfluoxetine inhibit many isozymes of the cytochrome P450 system that are involved in drug metabolism. Both are potent inhibitors of CYP2D6 (which is also the chief enzyme responsible for their metabolism) and CYP2C19, and mild to moderate inhibitors of CYP2B6 and CYP2C9. In vivo, fluoxetine and norfluoxetine do not significantly affect the activity of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4. They also inhibit the activity of P-glycoprotein, a type of membrane transport protein that plays an important role in drug transport and metabolism and hence P-glycoprotein substrates such as loperamide may have their central effects potentiated. This extensive effect on the body's pathways for drug metabolism creates the potential for interactions with many commonly used drugs.  Its use should also be avoided in those receiving other serotonergic drugs such as monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, methamphetamine, amphetamine, MDMA, triptans, buspirone, ginseng, dextromethorphan (DXM), linezolid, tramadol, serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and other SSRIs due to the potential for serotonin syndrome to develop as a result.  Fluoxetine may also increase the risk of opioid overdose in some instances, in part due to its inhibitory effect on cytochrome P-450. Similar to how fluoxetine can effect the metabolization of dextromethorphan, it may cause medications like oxycodone to not be metabolized at a normal rate, thus increasing the risk of serotonin syndrome as well as resulting in an increased concentration of oxycodone in the blood, which may lead to accidental overdose. A 2022 study which examined the health insurance claims of over 2 million Americans who began taking oxycodone while using SSRIs between 2000 and 2020, found that patients taking paroxetine or fluoxetine had a 23% higher risk of overdosing on oxycodone than those using other SSRIs.  There is also the potential for interaction with highly protein-bound drugs due to the potential for fluoxetine to displace said drugs from the plasma or vice versa hence increasing serum concentrations of either fluoxetine or the offending agent.  Pharmacology  Pharmacodynamics  Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and does not appreciably inhibit norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake at therapeutic doses. It does, however, delay the reuptake of serotonin, resulting in serotonin persisting longer when it is released. Large doses in rats have been shown to induce a significant increase in synaptic norepinephrine and dopamine. Thus, dopamine and norepinephrine may contribute to the antidepressant action of fluoxetine in humans at supratherapeutic doses (60–80 mg). This effect may be mediated by 5HT2C receptors, which are inhibited by higher concentrations of fluoxetine.  Fluoxetine increases the concentration of circulating allopregnanolone, a potent GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulator, in the brain. Norfluoxetine, a primary active metabolite of fluoxetine, produces a similar effect on allopregnanolone levels in the brains of mice. Additionally, both fluoxetine and norfluoxetine are such modulators themselves, actions which may be clinically relevant.  In addition, fluoxetine has been found to act as an agonist of the σ1-receptor, with a potency greater than that of citalopram but less than that of fluvoxamine. However, the significance of this property is not fully clear. Fluoxetine also functions as a channel blocker of anoctamin 1, a calcium-activated chloride channel. A number of other ion channels, including nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and 5-HT3 receptors, are also known to be  at similar concentrations.  Fluoxetine has been shown to inhibit acid sphingomyelinase, a key regulator of ceramide levels which derives ceramide from sphingomyelin.  Mechanism of action While it is unclear how fluoxetine exerts its effect on mood, it has been suggested that fluoxetine elicits antidepressant effect by inhibiting serotonin reuptake in the synapse by binding to the reuptake pump on the neuronal membrane to increase serotonin availability and enhance neurotransmission. Over time, this leads to a downregulation of pre-synaptic 5-HT1A receptors, which is associated with an improvement in passive stress tolerance, and delayed downstream increase in expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which may contribute to a reduction in negative affective biases. Norfluoxetine and desmethylfluoxetine are metabolites of fluoxetine and also act as serotonin reuptake inhibitors, increasing the duration of action of the drug.  Prolonged exposure to fluoxetine changes the expression of genes involved in myelination, a process that shapes brain connectivity and contributes to symptoms of psychiatric disorders. The regulation of genes involved with myelination is partially responsible for the long-term therapeutic benefits of chronic SSRI exposure.  Pharmacokinetics  The bioavailability of fluoxetine is relatively high (72%), and peak plasma concentrations are reached in 6–8 hours. It is highly bound to plasma proteins, mostly albumin and α1-glycoprotein. Fluoxetine is metabolized in the liver by isoenzymes of the cytochrome P450 system, including CYP2D6. The role of CYP2D6 in the metabolism of fluoxetine may be clinically important, as there is great genetic variability in the function of this enzyme among people. CYP2D6 is responsible for converting fluoxetine to its only active metabolite, norfluoxetine. Both drugs are also potent inhibitors of CYP2D6.  The extremely slow elimination of fluoxetine and its active metabolite norfluoxetine from the body distinguishes it from other antidepressants. With time, fluoxetine and norfluoxetine inhibit their own metabolism, so fluoxetine elimination half-life increases from 1 to 3 days, after a single dose, to 4 to 6 days, after long-term use. Similarly, the half-life of norfluoxetine is longer (16 days) after long-term use. Therefore, the concentration of the drug and its active metabolite in the blood continues to grow through the first few weeks of treatment, and their steady concentration in the blood is achieved only after four weeks. Moreover, the brain concentration of fluoxetine and its metabolites keeps increasing through at least the first five weeks of treatment. For major depressive disorder, while onset of antidepressant action may be felt as early as 1–2 weeks, the full benefit of the current dose a patient receives is not realized for at least a month following ingestion. For example, in one 6-week study, the median time to achieving consistent response was 29 days. Likewise, complete excretion of the drug may take several weeks. During the first week after treatment discontinuation, the brain concentration of fluoxetine decreases by only 50%, The blood level of norfluoxetine four weeks after treatment discontinuation is about 80% of the level registered by the end of the first treatment week, and, seven weeks after discontinuation, norfluoxetine is still detectable in the blood.  Measurement in body fluids Fluoxetine and norfluoxetine may be quantitated in blood, plasma or serum to monitor therapy, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized person or assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Blood or plasma fluoxetine concentrations are usually in a range of 50–500 μg/L in persons taking the drug for its antidepressant effects, 900–3000 μg/L in survivors of acute overdosage and 1000–7000 μg/L in victims of fatal overdosage. Norfluoxetine concentrations are approximately equal to those of the parent drug during chronic therapy, but may be substantially less following acute overdosage, since it requires at least 1–2 weeks for the metabolite to achieve equilibrium.  History  The work which eventually led to the discovery of fluoxetine began at Eli Lilly and Company in 1970 as a collaboration between Bryan Molloy and Ray Fuller. It was known at that time that the antihistamine diphenhydramine shows some antidepressant-like properties. 3-Phenoxy-3-phenylpropylamine, a compound structurally similar to diphenhydramine, was taken as a starting point. Molloy and fellow Eli Lilly chemist Klaus Schmiegel synthesized a series of dozens of its derivatives. Hoping to find a derivative inhibiting only serotonin reuptake, another Eli Lilly scientist, David T. Wong, proposed to retest the series for the in vitro reuptake of serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine, using a technique developed by neuroscientist Solomon Snyder. This test showed the compound later named fluoxetine to be the most potent and selective inhibitor of serotonin reuptake of the series. The first article about fluoxetine was published in 1974. A year later, it was given the official chemical name fluoxetine and the Eli Lilly and Company gave it the brand name Prozac. In February 1977, Dista Products Company, a division of Eli Lilly & Company, filed an Investigational New Drug application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for fluoxetine.  Fluoxetine appeared on the Belgian market in 1986. In the U.S., the FDA gave its final approval in December 1987, and a month later Eli Lilly began marketing Prozac; annual sales in the U.S. reached $350 million within a year. Worldwide sales eventually reached a peak of $2.6 billion a year.  Lilly tried several product line extension strategies, including extended release formulations and paying for clinical trials to test the efficacy and safety of fluoxetine in premenstrual dysphoric disorder and rebranding fluoxetine for that indication as \"Sarafem\" after it was approved by the FDA in 2000, following the recommendation of an advisory committee in 1999. The invention of using fluoxetine to treat PMDD was made by Richard Wurtman at MIT; the patent was licensed to his startup, Interneuron, which in turn sold it to Lilly.  To defend its Prozac revenue from generic competition, Lilly also fought a five-year, multimillion-dollar battle in court with the generic company Barr Pharmaceuticals to protect its patents on fluoxetine, and lost the cases for its line-extension patents, other than those for Sarafem, opening fluoxetine to generic manufacturers starting in 2001. When Lilly's patent expired in August 2001, generic drug competition decreased Lilly's sales of fluoxetine by 70% within two months.  In 2000 an investment bank had projected that annual sales of Sarafem could reach $250M/year. Sales of Sarafem reached about $85M/year in 2002, and in that year Lilly sold its assets connected with the drug for $295M to Galen Holdings, a small Irish pharmaceutical company specializing in dermatology and women's health that had a sales force tasked to gynecologists' offices; analysts found the deal sensible since the annual sales of Sarafem made a material financial difference to Galen, but not to Lilly.  Bringing Sarafem to market harmed Lilly's reputation in some quarters. The diagnostic category of PMDD was controversial since it was first proposed in 1987, and Lilly's role in retaining it in the appendix of the DSM-IV-TR, the discussions for which got under way in 1998, has been criticized. Lilly was criticized for inventing a disease in order to make money, and for not innovating but rather just seeking ways to continue making money from existing drugs. It was also criticized by the FDA and groups concerned with women's health for marketing Sarafem too aggressively when it was first launched; the campaign included a television commercial featuring a harried woman at the grocery store who asks herself if she has PMDD.  Society and culture  Prescription trends  In 2010, over 24.4 million prescriptions for generic fluoxetine were filled in the United States, making it the third-most prescribed antidepressant after sertraline and citalopram.  In 2011, 6 million prescriptions for fluoxetine were filled in the United Kingdom. Between 1998 and 2017, along with amitriptyline, it was the most commonly prescribed first antidepressant for adolescents aged 12–17 years in England.  Environmental effects Fluoxetine has been detected in aquatic ecosystems, especially in North America. There is a growing body of research addressing the effects of fluoxetine (among other SSRIs) exposure on non-target aquatic species.  In 2003, one of the first studies addressed in detail the potential effects of fluoxetine on aquatic wildlife; this research concluded that exposure at environmental concentrations was of little risk to aquatic systems if a hazard quotient approach was applied to risk assessment. However, they also stated the need for further research addressing sub-lethal consequences of fluoxetine, specifically focusing on study species' sensitivity, behavioural responses, and endpoints modulated by the serotonin system.  Fluoxetine  similar to several other SSRIs  induces reproductive behavior in some shellfish at concentrations as low as 10 M, or 30 parts per trillion.  Since 2003, a number of studies have reported fluoxetine-induced impacts on a number of behavioural and physiological endpoints, inducing antipredator behaviour, reproduction, and foraging at or below field-detected concentrations. However, a 2014 review on the ecotoxicology of fluoxetine concluded that, at that time, a consensus on the ability of environmentally realistic dosages to affect the behaviour of wildlife could not be reached. At environmentally realistic concentrations, fluoxetine alters insect emergence timing. Richmond et al., 2019 find that at low concentrations it accelerates emergence of Diptera, while at unusually high concentrations it has no discernable effect.  Several common plants are known to absorb fluoxetine. Several crops have been tested, and Redshaw et al. 2008 find that cauliflower absorbs large amounts into the stem and leaf but not the head or root. Wu et al. 2012 find that lettuce and spinach also absorb detectable amounts, while Carter et al. 2014 find that radish (Raphanus sativus), ryegrass (Lolium perenne) – and Wu et al. 2010 find that soybean (Glycine max) – absorb little. Wu tested all tissues of soybean and all showed only low concentrations. By contrast various Reinhold et al. 2010 find duckweeds have a high uptake of fluoxetine and show promise for bioremediation of contaminated water, especially Lemna minor and Landoltia punctata. Ecotoxicity for organisms involved in aquaculture is well documented. Fluoxetine affects both aquacultured invertebrates and vertebrates, and inhibits soil microbes including a large antibacterial effect. For applications of this see .  Politics During the 1990 campaign for governor of Florida, it was disclosed that one of the candidates, Lawton Chiles, had depression and had resumed taking fluoxetine, leading his political opponents to question his fitness to serve as governor.  American aircraft pilots Beginning 5 April 2010, fluoxetine became one of four antidepressant drugs that the FAA permitted for pilots with authorization from an aviation medical examiner. The other permitted antidepressants are sertraline (Zoloft), citalopram (Celexa), and escitalopram (Lexapro). These four remain the only antidepressants permitted by FAA   Sertraline, citalopram and escitalopram are the only antidepressants permitted for EASA medical certification, as of January 2019.  Other uses The antibacterial effect in described above () could be applied against multiresistant biotypes in crop bacterial diseases and bacterial aquaculture diseases. In a glucocorticoid receptor-defective zebrafish mutant (Danio rerio) with reduced exploratory behavior, fluoxetine rescued the normal exploratory behavior. This demonstrates relationships between glucocorticoids, fluoxetine, and exploration in this fish.  Fluoxetine has an anti-nematode effect. Choy et al., 1999 finds some of this effect is due to interference with certain transmembrane proteins.

    "text": "A ceasefire (also known as a truce or armistice), also spelled cease fire (the antonym of 'open fire'), is a temporary stoppage of a war in which each side agrees with the other to suspend aggressive actions. Ceasefires may be between state actors or involve non-state actors.  Ceasefires may be declared as part of a formal treaty, but also as part of an informal understanding between opposing forces. They may occur via mediation or otherwise as part of a peace process or be imposed by United Nations Security Council resolutions via Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter.  The immediate goal of a ceasefire is to stop violence, but the underlying purposes of ceasefires vary. Ceasefires may be intended to meet short-term limited needs (such as providing humanitarian aid), manage a conflict to make it less devastating, or advance efforts to peacefully resolve a dispute. An actor may not always intend for a ceasefire to advance the peaceful resolution of a conflict, but instead give the actor an upper hand in the conflict (for example, by re-arming and repositioning forces or attacking an unsuspecting adversary), which creates bargaining problems that may make ceasefires less likely to be implemented and less likely to be durable if implemented.  The durability of ceasefire agreements is affected by several factors, such as demilitarized zones, withdrawal of troops and third-party guarantees and monitoring (e.g. peacekeeping). Ceasefire agreements are more likely to be durable when they reduce incentives to attack, reduce uncertainty about the adversary's intentions, and when mechanisms are put in place to prevent and control accidents from developing into conflict.  Overview Ceasefire agreements are more likely to be reached when the costs of conflict are high and when the actors in a conflict have lower audience costs. Scholars emphasize that war termination is more likely to occur when actors have more information about each other, when actors can make credible commitments, and when the domestic political situation makes it possible for leaders to make war termination agreements without incurring domestic punishment.  By one estimate, there were at least 2202 ceasefires across 66 countries in 109 civil conflicts over the period 1989–2020.  Historical examples Historically, the concept of a ceasefire existed at least by the time of the Middle Ages, when it was known as a 'truce of God'.  World War I  During World War I, on December 24, 1914, there was an unofficial ceasefire on the Western Front as France, the United Kingdom, and Germany observed Christmas. There are accounts that claimed the unofficial ceasefire took place throughout the week leading to Christmas, and that British and German troops exchanged seasonal greetings and songs between their trenches. The ceasefire was brief but spontaneous. Beginning when German soldiers lit Christmas trees, it quickly spread up and down the Western Front. One account described the development in the following words:  It was good to see the human spirit prevailed amongst all sides at the front, the sharing and fraternity. All was well until the higher echelons of command got to hear about the effect of the ceasefire, whereby their wrath ensured a return to hostilities.  There was no peace treaty signed during the Christmas truce, and the war resumed after a few days.  Karachi Agreement  The Karachi Agreement of 1949 was signed by the military representatives of India and Pakistan, supervised by the United Nations Commission for India and Pakistan, establishing a cease-fire line in Kashmir following the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947.  Korean War On November 29, 1952, the US president-elect, Dwight D. Eisenhower, went to Korea to see how to end the Korean War. With the UN's acceptance of India's proposed armistice, the ceasefire of the Korean People's Army (KPA), the People's Volunteer Army (PVA), and the UN Command had the battle line approximately at the 38th parallel north. These parties signed the Korean Armistice Agreement on July 27, 1953, to end the fighting. South Korean President Syngman Rhee attacked the peace proceedings and did not sign the armistice. Upon agreeing to the ceasefire agreement, which called upon the governments of South Korea, North Korea, China, and the United States to participate in continued peace talks. The principal belligerents established the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), which has since been patrolled by the KPA and the joint Republic of Korea Army, US, and UN Command. The war is considered to have ended at that point even though there still is no peace treaty.  Vietnam War On New Years Day, 1968, Pope Paul VI convinced South Vietnam and the United States to declare a 24-hour-truce. However, the Viet Cong and North Vietnam did not adhere to the truce, and ambushed the 2nd Battalion, Republic of Vietnam Marine Division, 10 minutes after midnight in Mỹ Tho. The Viet Cong would also attack a U.S. Army fire support base near Saigon, causing more casualties.  On January 15, 1973, US President Richard Nixon ordered a ceasefire of the aerial bombings in North Vietnam. The decision came after Henry Kissinger, the National Security Advisor to the President, returned to Washington, D.C., from Paris, France, with a draft peace proposal. Combat missions continued in South Vietnam. By January 27, 1973, all parties of the Vietnam War signed a ceasefire as a prelude to the Paris Peace Accord.  Gulf War After Iraq was driven out of Kuwait by US-led coalition forces during Operation Desert Storm, Iraq and the UN Security Council signed a ceasefire agreement on March 3, 1991. Subsequently, throughout the 1990s, the U.N. Security Council passed numerous resolutions calling for Iraq to disarm its weapons of mass destruction unconditionally and immediately. Because no peace treaty was signed after the Gulf War, the war still remained in effect, including an alleged assassination attempt of former US President George H. W. Bush by Iraqi agents while on a visit to Kuwait; Iraq being bombed in June 1993 as a response, Iraqi forces firing on coalition aircraft patrolling the Iraqi no-fly zones, US President Bill Clinton's bombing of Baghdad in 1998 during Operation Desert Fox, and an earlier 1996 bombing of Iraq by the US during Operation Desert Strike. The war remained in effect until 2003, when US and UK forces invaded Iraq and toppled Saddam Hussein's regime from power.  Kashmir conflict  A UN-mediated ceasefire was agreed between India and Pakistan, on 1 January 1949, ending the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947 (also called the 1947 Kashmir War). Fighting broke out between the two newly independent countries in Kashmir in October 1947, with India intervening on behalf of the princely ruler of Kashmir, who had joined India, and Pakistan supporting the rebels. The fighting was limited to Kashmir, but, apprehensive that it might develop into a full-scale international war, India referred the matter to the UN Security Council under Article 35 of the UN Charter, which addresses situations \"likely to endanger the maintenance of international peace\". The Security Council set up the dedicated United Nations Commission for India and Pakistan, which mediated for an entire year as the fighting continued. After several UN resolutions outlining a procedure for resolving the dispute via a plebiscite, a ceasefire agreement was reached between the countries towards the end of December 1948, which came into effect in the New Year. The Security Council set up the United Nations Military Observer Group for India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP) to monitor the ceasefire line. India declared a ceasefire in Kashmir Valley during Ramadan in 2018.  Northern Ireland The Irish Republican Army held several Christmas ceasefires (usually referred to as truces) during the Northern Ireland conflict.  Israeli–Palestinian conflict An example of a ceasefire in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict was announced between Israel and the Palestinian National Authority on February 8, 2005. When announced, chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat publicly defined the ceasefire as follows: \"We have agreed that today President Mahmoud Abbas will declare a full cessation of violence against Israelis anywhere and Prime Minister Ariel Sharon will declare a full cessation of violence and military activities against Palestinians anywhere.\"  Syrian Civil War  Several attempts have been made to broker ceasefires in the Syrian Civil War.  2020 global ceasefire   The 2020 global ceasefire was a response to a formal appeal by United Nations Secretary-General António Manuel de Oliveira Guterres on March 23 for a global ceasefire as part of the United Nations' response to the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic. On 24 June 2020, 170 UN Member States and Observers signed a non-binding statement in support of the appeal, rising to 172 on 25 June 2020, and on 1 July 2020, the UN Security Council passed a resolution demanding a general and immediate global cessation of hostilities for at least 90 days.

    "text": "Cham (Cham: ꨌꩌ) is a Malayo-Polynesian language of the Austronesian family, spoken by the Chams of Southeast Asia. It is spoken primarily in the territory of the former Kingdom of Champa, which spanned modern Southern Vietnam, as well as in Cambodia by a significant population which descends from refugees that fled during the decline and fall of Champa. The Western variety is spoken by 220,000 people in Cambodia and 25,000 people in Vietnam. As for the Eastern variety, there are about 73,000 speakers in Vietnam, for a total of approximately 320,000 speakers.  Cham belongs to the Chamic languages, which are spoken in parts of mainland Southeast Asia, Indonesia's Aceh Province, and on the island of Hainan. Cham is the oldest-attested Austronesian language, with the Đông Yên Châu inscription being verifiably dated to the late 4th century AD.  Phonology The Cham language dialects each have 21 consonants and 9 vowels.  Consonants    in Western Cham is heard as a velar fricative . In Eastern Cham, it is heard as an alveolar flap , glide , or trill .  Vowels  Monophthongs  Diphthongs ,  (occurs only before ), , , ,  (occurs only before ), , , , .  Grammar  Word formation There are several prefixes and infixes which can be used for word derivation.  prefix pa-: causative, sometimes giving more force to the word thau (to know) → pathau (to inform) blei (to buy) → pablei (to sell) biér (low) → pabiér (to lower) yao (like, as) → payao (to compare) jâ (finished) → pajâ (well finished) prefix mâ-: sometimes causative, often indicates a state, possession, mutuality, reciprocity jru (poison) → mâjru (to poison)  (teacher) → mâgru (to study) tian (belly) → mâtian (pregnancy) boh (egg, fruit) → mâboh (lay an egg, give fruit) daké (horn) → mâdaké (having horns) prefix ta- or da-: frequentative galung (to roll) → tagalung (to roll around) dep (to hide oneself) → dadep (to be  to hide oneself) infix -an-: noun formation puec (to speak) → panuec (speech) tiw (row) → taniw (oar) dok (to live) → danok (house, living place) infix -mâ-: no specific meaning payao (to compare) → pamâyao (to compare)  Reduplication is often used: palei, pala-palei (country) rambah, rambah-rambâp (misery)  Syntax and word order Cham generally uses SVO word order, without any case marking to distinguish subject from object:  Dummy pronominal subjects are sometimes used, echoing the subject:  Composite verbs will behave as one inseparable verb, having the object come after it:  Sometimes, however, the verb is placed in front of the subject:  Auxiliary verbs are placed after any objects:  If a sentence contains more than one main verb, one of the two will have an adverbial meaning:  Adjectives come after the nouns they modify:  If the order is reversed, the whole will behave like a compound:  Composite sentences can be formed with the particle krung:  It is also possible to leave out this particle, without change in meaning:  Questions are formed with the sentence-final particle rẽi:  Other question words are in situ:  Nominals Like many languages in Eastern Asia, Cham uses numeral classifiers to express amounts. The classifier will always come after the numeral, with the noun coming invariably before or after the classifier-numeral pair.  The above examples show the classifier boḥ, which literally means \"egg\" and is the most frequently used — particularly for round and voluminous objects. Other classifiers are ôrang (person) for people and deities, ḅêk for long objects, blaḥ (leaf) for flat objects, and many others.  The days of the month are counted with a similar system, with two classifiers: one (bangun) used to count days before the full moon, and the other one (ranaṃ) for days after the full moon.  Personal pronouns behave like ordinary nouns and do not show any case distinctions. There are different forms depending on the level of politeness. The first person singular, for example, is kău in formal or distant context, while it is dahlak (in Vietnam) or hulun (in Cambodia) in an ordinarily polite context. As is the case with many other languages of the region, kinship terms are often used as personal pronouns.  Comparative and superlative are expressed with the locative preposition di/dii:  Verbs There are some particles that can be used to indicate tense/aspect. The future is indicated with si or thi in Vietnam, with hi or si in Cambodia. The perfect is expressed with jâ. The first one comes in front of the verb:  The second one is sentence-final:  Certain verbs can function as auxiliaries to express other tenses or aspects. The verb dok (\"to stay\") is used for the continuous, wâk (\"to return\") for the repetitive aspect, and kieng (\"to want\") for the future tense.  The negation is formed with oh/o at either or both sides of the verb, or with di/dii in front.  The imperative is formed with the sentence-final particle bék, and the negative imperative with the preverbal juai/juei (in Vietnam and Cambodia respectively).  Sociolinguistics  Diglossia Brunelle observed two phenomena of language use among speakers of Eastern Cham: They are both diglossic and bilingual (in Cham and Vietnamese). Diglossia is the situation where two varieties of a language are used in a single language community, and oftentimes one is used on formal occasions (labelled H) and the other is more colloquial (labelled L).  Dialectal differences Cham is divided into two primary dialects.  Western Cham: It is spoken by the Chams in Cambodia as well as in the adjacent Vietnamese provinces of An Giang and Tây Ninh. Eastern Cham: It is spoken by the coastal Cham population in the Vietnamese provinces of Bình Thuận, Ninh Thuận, and Đồng Nai.  The two regions where Cham is spoken are separated both geographically and culturally. The more numerous Western Cham are predominantly Muslims (although some in Cambodia now practice Theravāda Buddhism), while the Eastern Cham practice both Hinduism and Islam. Ethnologue states that the Eastern and Western dialects are no longer mutually intelligible. The table below gives some examples of words where the two dialects differed as of the 19th century.  {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! !

(2014:175) lists a few Cham subgroups. Chăm Poông: in Thạnh Hiếu village, Phan Hiệp commune, Bắc Bình District, Bình Thuận Province. The Chăm Poông practice burial instead of cremation as the surrounding Cham do. Chăm Hroi (population 4,000): in Phước Vân District (Bình Định Province), Đồng Xuân District (Phú Yên Province), and Tây Sơn District (Bình Định Province) Chàvà Ku, a mixed Malay-Khmer people in Châu Đốc  Writing systems Cham script is a Brahmic script. The script has two varieties: Akhar Thrah (Eastern Cham) and Akhar Srak (Western Cham). The Western Cham language is written with the Arabic script or the aforementioned Akhar Srak.  Dictionaries The Ming dynasty Chinese Bureau of Translators produced a Chinese-Cham dictionary.

    "text": "Wilbert Tucker Woodson High School, commonly known as W.T. Woodson High School or simply Woodson, (in the process of renaming to Carter G. Woodson High School) is a high school located in Fairfax County, Virginia, in the east end of the city of Fairfax, opposite the shopping center on Main Street.  The school opened in 1962 and was once the largest school in the state. It is named for W. T. Woodson, who served as Fairfax County School Superintendent from 1929 to 1961. As of 2022-2023, the student population was 2,220. Woodson has the largest campus in Fairfax County in size of area, and also houses Woodson Adult High School, a separate education facility run by FCPS that allows adults to earn their GEDs and HS diplomas. Woodson has appeared multiple times on Newsweek magazine's lists of top or best high schools, including #23 (2003), #34 (2005), #90 (2006), and #74 (2008).  Woodson has also appeared on the top high schools lists from U.S. News & World Report: #90 (2008), #116 (2013), #200 (2016), #365 (2019), and #280 (2020)   The principal as of September 2023 is Kevin Greata.  Demographics  For the 2021–22 school year, Woodson High School's student body was 48.68% white non-Hispanic, 25.23% Asian, 13.37% Hispanic, 5.18% black, and 7.54% Other.  Renovation  Woodson began the process of renovating all of its facilities in 2005 and adding several classrooms. The project was paid for in bonds that were established in 2003 by a voter referendum. The issue of whether to renovate had been debated for several years before the plan was approved. Woodson was one of the oldest schools in Fairfax County Public Schools, as the main facilities (plumbing, heating/cooling, floors, electrical) were still fundamentally the same as they were when the structure was built. The renovations nearly doubled the square footage of the school.  The project was completed in 2009. The renovation consisted of complete renovation to all existing interior spaces, as well as adding to the performing arts and athletic wings, creating a new administration wing with a new front entrance, highlighted by a large tower and the addition of a new science classroom wing and two student drop off areas.  Activities, groups, and programs Woodson's mascot is a Cavalier and the sports teams play in the AAA Patriot District and the Northern Region. In 1976, the Washington Diplomats of the North American Soccer League used the school's stadium as their home field.  In a Diplomats game on June 27, 1976, soccer legend Pelé, playing for the New York Cosmos, scored a goal in a game held at Woodson.  Publications The Cavalcade is the school newspaper.  The Cavalier, Woodson's yearbook, is a AAA publication.  Communities served by Woodson Several unincorporated areas, such as Mantua, Olde Creek, Canterbury Woods, Truro, Rutherford, Long Branch, and Wakefield Forest are served by Woodson.  Woodson in the news On April 1, 1973, a strong tornado struck Woodson High School and ripped off the roof. It was hit on a Sunday and no injuries were reported among the 65-75 people playing basketball in the school gymnasium. The students did a split shift with Oakton High School to finish out the school year. Graduation ceremonies were held on their home football field. A second tornado spawned by the remains of Hurricane David severely damaged the school's stadium on September 5, 1979, causing an estimated $45,000 in damage. On October 30, 2015, five students and a teacher were injured in an accidental fire caused by a chemistry experiment. Two of the injured students were airlifted to a local hospital, one of whom was left in critical condition. The incident received coverage from the Washington Post, and New York Times. The event also prompted a statement from the U.S. Chemical Safety Board, who considered launching an investigation into the incident, but eventually opted against doing so. On January 30, 2022, a fire broke out in one of the school's administrative buildings adjacent to the main school building. Investigators did not determine a reason for the fire, which was reported to have caused $8.8 million in damages. The remains of the building would eventually be scheduled for demolition.  Suicide and mental health crisis  Between 2011 and 2014, six Woodson students died by suicide. Woodson continues to be considered among the top high schools in Virginia, and some parents pointed to the school's competitive environment as a possible cause for the poor mental health of its students. Following the suicides of 2014, the Virginia officials requested assistance from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the primary public health agency of the US federal government. CDC officials were sent to Northern Virginia to conduct focus group activities that attempted to identify possible causes of the suicides. Woodson itself also received $50,000 in federal aid for use in implementing mental health resources for its students. Another suicide of a Woodson student was reported in 2017.

    "text": "Guys and Dolls is a musical with music and lyrics by Frank Loesser and book by Jo Swerling and Abe Burrows. It is based on \"The Idyll of Miss Sarah Brown\" (1933) and \"Blood Pressure\", which are two short stories by Damon Runyon, and also borrows characters and plot elements from other Runyon stories, such as \"Pick the Winner\". The show premiered on Broadway in 1950, where it ran for 1,200 performances and won the Tony Award for Best Musical. The musical has had several Broadway and London revivals, as well as a 1955 film adaptation starring Frank Sinatra, Marlon Brando, Jean Simmons, and Vivian Blaine.  In 1998, Vivian Blaine, Sam Levene, Robert Alda and Isabel Bigley, along with the original Broadway cast of the 1950 Decca cast album, were  inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.  Background Guys and Dolls was conceived by producers Cy Feuer and Ernest Martin as an adaptation of Damon Runyon's short stories. These stories, written in the 1920s and 1930s, concerned gangsters, gamblers, and other characters of the New York underworld. Runyon was known for the unique comic dialect he employed in his stories; mixing highly formal language, without contractions, and colorful slang. Frank Loesser, who had spent most of his career as a lyricist for movie musicals, was hired as composer and lyricist. George S. Kaufman was hired as director. When the first version of the show's book, or dialogue, written by Jo Swerling was deemed unusable, Feuer and Martin asked radio comedy writer Abe Burrows to rewrite it.  Loesser had already written much of the score to correspond with the first version of the book. Burrows later recalled:  Frank Loesser's fourteen songs were all great, and the [new book] had to be written so that the story would lead into each of them. Later on, the critics spoke of the show as 'integrated'. The word integration usually means that the composer has written songs that follow the story line gracefully. Well, we accomplished that but we did it in reverse.  Abe Burrows specifically crafted the role of Nathan Detroit around Sam Levene who signed for the project long before Burrows wrote a single word of dialogue, a similar break Burrows said he had when he later wrote Cactus Flower for Lauren Bacall. In “Honest, Abe: Is There Really No Business Like Show Business?”, Burrows recalls \"I had the sound of their voices in my head. I knew the rhythm of their speech and it helped make the dialogue sharper and more real\". Although Broadway and movie veteran Sam Levene was not a singer, it was agreed he was otherwise perfect as Nathan Detroit; indeed, Levene was one of Runyon's favorite actors. Frank Loesser agreed it was easier adjusting the music to Levene's limitations than substituting a better singer who couldn't act. Levene's lack of singing ability is the reason the lead role of Nathan Detroit only has one song, the duet \"Sue Me\".  Composer and lyricist Frank Loesser specifically wrote \"Sue Me\" for Sam Levene, and structured the song so he and Vivian Blaine never sang their showstopping duet together. The son of a cantor, Sam Levene was fluent in Yiddish: \"Alright, already, I'm just a no-goodnick; alright, already, it’s true, so nu? So sue me.\" Frank Loesser felt \"Nathan Detroit should be played as a brassy Broadway tough guy who sang with more grits than gravy. Sam Levene sang “Sue Me” with such a wonderful Runyonesque flavor that his singing had been easy to forgive, in fact it had been quite charming in its ineptitude.\" \"Musically, Sam Levene may have been tone-deaf, but he inhabited Frank Loesser's world as a character more than a caricature\", says Larry Stempel, a music professor at Fordham University and the author of Showtime: A History of the Broadway Musical Theater.  The character of Miss Adelaide was created specifically to fit Vivian Blaine into the musical, after Loesser decided she was ill-suited to play the conservative Sarah. When Loesser suggested reprising some songs in the second act, Kaufman warned: \"If you reprise the songs, we'll reprise the jokes.\"  Synopsis  Act I A pantomime of never-ceasing activities depicts the hustle and bustle of New York City (\"Runyonland\"). Three small-time gamblers, Nicely-Nicely Johnson, Benny Southstreet, and Rusty Charlie, argue over which horse will win a big race (\"Fugue for Tinhorns\"). The band members of the Save-a-Soul Mission, led by the pious and beautiful Sergeant Sarah Brown, call for sinners to \"Follow the Fold\" and repent. Nicely and Benny's employer, Nathan Detroit, runs an illegal floating crap game. Due to local policeman Lt. Brannigan's strong-armed presence, he has found only one likely spot to hold the game: the \"Biltmore garage\". Its owner, Joey Biltmore, requires a $1,000 security deposit, and Nathan is broke (\"The Oldest Established\"). Nathan hopes to win a $1,000 bet against Sky Masterson, a gambler willing to bet on virtually anything. Nathan proposes a bet he believes he cannot lose: Sky must take a woman of Nathan's choice to dinner in Havana, Cuba. Sky agrees, and Nathan chooses Sarah Brown.  At the mission, Sky attempts to make a deal with Sarah; offering her \"one dozen genuine sinners\" in exchange for the date in Havana. Sarah refuses, and they argue over whom they will fall in love with (\"I'll Know\"). Sky kisses Sarah, and she slaps him. Nathan goes to watch his fiancée of 14 years, Adelaide, perform her nightclub act (\"A Bushel and a Peck\"). After her show, she asks him to marry her once again, telling him that she has been sending her mother letters for twelve years claiming that they have been married with five children. She finds out that Nathan is still running the crap game. After kicking him out, she reads a medical book telling her that her long-running cold may be due to Nathan's refusal to marry her (\"Adelaide's Lament\").  The next day, Nicely and Benny watch as Sky pursues Sarah, and Nathan tries to win back Adelaide's favor. They declare that guys will do anything for the dolls they love (\"Guys and Dolls\"). General Cartwright, the leader of Save-a-Soul, visits the mission and explains that she will be forced to close the branch unless they succeed in bringing some sinners to the upcoming revival meeting. Sarah, desperate to save the mission, promises the General \"one dozen genuine sinners\", implicitly accepting Sky's deal. Brannigan discovers a group of gamblers waiting for Nathan's crap game, and to convince him of their innocence, they tell Brannigan their gathering is Nathan's \"surprise bachelor party\". This satisfies Brannigan, and Nathan resigns himself to eloping with Adelaide. Adelaide goes home to pack, promising to meet him after her show the next afternoon. The Save-A-Soul Mission band passes by, and Nathan sees that Sarah is not in it; he realizes that he lost the bet and faints.  In a Havana nightclub, Sky buys a \"Cuban milkshake\" for himself and Sarah. She doesn't realize that the drink contains Bacardi rum, and she gets drunk and kisses Sky (\"If I Were a Bell\"). Sky realizes that he genuinely cares for Sarah, and he takes her back to New York. They return at around 4:00 a.m., and Sky tells Sarah how much he loves the early morning (\"My Time of Day\"). They both spontaneously admit that they're in love (\"I've Never Been in Love Before\"). A siren sounds and gamblers run out of the mission, where Nathan has been holding the crap game. Sarah assumes that Sky took her to Havana so Nathan could run the game in the mission, and she walks out on him.  Act II The next evening, Adelaide performs her act (\"Take Back Your Mink\"). Nathan doesn't show up for the elopement because he's still running the crap game. She soon realizes that Nathan has stood her up again (\"Adelaide's Second Lament\").  Sarah admits to Arvide, her uncle and fellow mission worker, that she does love Sky, but she will not see him again. Arvide expresses his faith in Sky's inherent goodness and urges Sarah to follow her heart (\"More I Cannot Wish You\"). Sky tells Sarah he intends to deliver the dozen genuine sinners for the revival. She doesn't believe him and walks off, but Arvide subtly encourages him.  Nicely shows Sky to the crap game; now in the sewers (\"Crapshooters Dance\"). Big Jule, a gambler, has lost a large sum of money and refuses to end the game until he earns it back. Sky arrives and fails to convince the crapshooters to come to the mission. He gives Nathan $1,000 and claims that he lost the bet to protect Sarah. Sky makes a last-minute bet to get the sinners; if he loses, everyone gets $1,000, but if he wins, they go to the mission (\"Luck Be a Lady\"). He wins the bet. Nathan runs into Adelaide on his way there. She tries to get him to elope, but when he can't, she walks out on him. Nathan professes his love for her (\"Sue Me\"), then leaves.  Sarah is shocked to see that Sky carried through on his promise. The General asks the gamblers to confess their sins, and while some do, one of them admits the real reason they are even there. The General is thrilled that good can come from evil. Attempting to appear contrite, Nicely invents a dream that encouraged him to repent, and the gamblers join in with revivalist fervor (\"Sit Down, You're Rockin' the Boat\"). Brannigan arrives and threatens to arrest everyone for the crap game in the Mission, but Sarah clears them, saying that none of the gamblers were at the mission the previous night. After Brannigan leaves, Nathan confesses that they held the crap game in the mission. He also confesses to the bet he made with Sky about taking Sarah to Havana. He adds that he won the bet, to Sarah's shock, and she realizes that Sky wanted to protect her reputation and must genuinely care about her.  Sarah and Adelaide run into each other, and they commiserate and then resolve to marry their men anyway and reform them later (\"Marry the Man Today\"). A few weeks later, Nathan owns a newsstand and has officially closed the crap game. Sky, who is now married to Sarah, works at the mission band and has also stopped gambling. The characters celebrate as Nathan and Adelaide are married (\"Guys and Dolls (Finale/Reprise)\").

The musical premiered on Broadway at the 46th Street Theatre (now Richard Rodgers Theatre) on November 24, 1950. It was directed by George S. Kaufman, with dances and musical numbers by Michael Kidd, scenic and lighting design by Jo Mielziner, costumes by Alvin Colt, and orchestrations by George Bassman and Ted Royal, with vocal arrangements by Herbert Greene. It starred Robert Alda (Sky Masterson), Sam Levene (Nathan Detroit), Isabel Bigley (Sarah) and Vivian Blaine (Miss Adelaide).  Iva Withers was a replacement as Miss Adelaide. The musical ran for 1,200 performances, winning five 1951 Tony Awards, including the award for Best Musical. Decca Records issued the original cast recording on 78 rpm records, which was later expanded and re-issued on LP, and then transferred to CD in the 1980s.  1953 First UK production The premiere West End production of Guys and Dolls opened at the London Coliseum on May 28, 1953, a few days before the 1953 Coronation and ran for 555 performances, including a Royal Command Variety Performance for Queen Elizabeth on November 2, 1953. Credited with above-the-title-billing the London cast co-starred Vivian Blaine as Miss Adelaide and Sam Levene as Nathan Detroit, each reprising their original Broadway performances; Jerry Wayne performed the role of Sky Masterson since Robert Alda did not reprise his Broadway role in the first UK production which co-starred Lizbeth Webb as Sarah Brown. Before opening at the Coliseum, Guys and Dolls had an eight performance run at the Bristol Hippodrome, where the show opened on May 19, 1953, and closed on May 25, 1953. Lizbeth Webb was the only major principal who was British and was chosen to play the part of Sarah Brown by Frank Loesser. The show has had numerous revivals and tours and has become a popular choice for school and community theatre productions.  1955 First Las Vegas production Vivian Blaine as Miss Adelaide, Sam Levene as Nathan Detroit and Robert Alda as Sky Masterson recreated their original Broadway performances twice daily in a slightly reduced version of Guys and Dolls when the first Las Vegas production opened a six-month run at the Royal Nevada, September 7, 1955, the first time a Broadway musical was performed on the Las Vegas Strip.  1965 Fifteenth Anniversary production In 1965 Vivian Blaine and Sam Levene reprised their original Broadway roles as Miss Adelaide and Nathan Detroit in a 15th anniversary revival of Guys and Dolls at the Mineola Theatre, Mineola, New York and Paramus Playhouse, New Jersey. Blaine and Levene performed the fifteenth anniversary production of Guys and Dolls for a limited run of 24 performances at each theatre.  New York City Center 1955, 1965 and 1966 revivals New York City Center mounted short runs of the musical in 1955, 1965 and 1966. A production starring Walter Matthau as Nathan Detroit, Helen Gallagher as Adelaide, Ray Shaw as Sky and Leila Martin as Sarah had 31 performances, running from April 20 to May 1, and May 31 to June 12, 1955.  Another presentation at City Center, with Alan King as Nathan Detroit, Sheila MacRae as Adelaide, Jerry Orbach as Sky and Anita Gillette as Sarah, ran for 15 performances from April 28 to May 9, 1965.  A 1966 production, starring Jan Murray as Nathan Detroit, Vivian Blaine reprising her role as Adelaide, Hugh O'Brian as Sky, and Barbara Meister as Sarah, ran for 23 performances, from June 8 to June 26, 1966.  1976 Broadway revival  An all-black cast staged the first Broadway revival of Guys and Dolls opened on July 10, 1976, in previews, officially on July 21, at The Broadway Theatre. It starred Robert Guillaume as Nathan Detroit, Norma Donaldson as Miss Adelaide, James Randolph as Sky, Ernestine Jackson as Sarah Brown, and Ken Page as Nicely-Nicely Johnson. Guillaume and Jackson were nominated for Tony and Drama Desk Awards, and Page won a Theatre World Award.  This production featured Motown-style musical arrangements by Danny Holgate and Horace Ott, and it was directed and choreographed by Billy Wilson. The entire production was under the supervision of Abe Burrows, and musical direction and choral arrangements were by Howard Roberts.  The show closed on February 13, 1977, after 12 previews and 239 performances. A cast recording was released subsequent to the show's opening.  1982 London revival Laurence Olivier had wanted to play Nathan Detroit, and began rehearsals for a planned 1971 London revival of Guys and Dolls for the National Theatre Company then based at the Old Vic. However, due to poor health he had to stop, and his revival never happened.  In 1982, Richard Eyre directed a major revival at London's National Theatre. Eyre called it a \"re-thinking\" of the musical, and his production featured an award-winning neon-lit set design inspired by Rudi Stern's 1979 book Let There Be Neon, and brassier orchestrations with vintage yet innovative harmonies. The show's choreography by David Toguri included a large-scale tap dance number of the \"Guys and Dolls\" finale, performed by the principals and entire cast. The revival opened March 9, 1982, and was an overnight sensation, running for nearly four years and breaking all box office records. The original cast featured Bob Hoskins as Nathan Detroit, Julia McKenzie as Adelaide, Ian Charleson as Sky and Julie Covington as Sarah. The production won five Olivier Awards, including for McKenzie and Eyre and for Best Musical. Eyre also won an Evening Standard Theatre Award, and Hoskins won the Critics' Circle Theatre Award.  In October 1982, Hoskins was replaced by Trevor Peacock, Charleson by Paul Jones, and Covington by Belinda Sinclair; in the spring of 1983, McKenzie was replaced by Imelda Staunton and Fiona Hendley replaced Sinclair. This production closed in late 1983 to make way for a Broadway try-out of the ill-fated musical Jean Seberg, which following critical failure closed after four months. Eyre's Guys and Dolls returned to the National from April through September 1984, this time starring Lulu, Norman Rossington, Clarke Peters and Betsy Brantley. After a nationwide tour, this production transferred to the West End at the Prince of Wales Theatre, where it ran from June 1985 to April 1986.  Following Ian Charleson's death from AIDS at the age of 40, in November 1990 two reunion performances of Guys and Dolls, with almost all of the original 1982 cast and musicians, were given at the National Theatre as a tribute to Charleson. The tickets sold out immediately, and the dress rehearsal was also packed. The proceeds from the performances were donated to the new Ian Charleson Day Centre HIV clinic at the Royal Free Hospital, and to scholarships in Charleson's name at LAMDA.  1992 Broadway revival  The 1992 Broadway revival was the most successful American remounting of the show since the original Broadway production which ran for 1,200 performances. Directed by Jerry Zaks, it starred Nathan Lane as Nathan Detroit (from whom Lane had taken his stage name), Peter Gallagher as Sky, Faith Prince as Adelaide and Josie de Guzman as Sarah. This production played at the Martin Beck Theatre from April 14, 1992, to January 8, 1995, with 1,143 performances.  The production received a rave review from Frank Rich in The New York Times, stating \"It's hard to know which genius, and I do mean genius, to celebrate first while cheering the entertainment at the Martin Beck.\" It received eight Tony Award nominations, and won four, including Best Revival, and the show also won the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Revival. This revival featured various revisions to the show's score, including brand new music for the \"Runyonland\", \"A Bushel and a Peck\", \"Take Back Your Mink\" and \"Havana\". The orchestrations were redesigned by Michael Starobin, and there were new dance arrangements added to \"A Bushel and a Peck\" and \"Take Back Your Mink\".  A one-hour documentary film captured the recording sessions of the production's original cast album. Titled Guys and Dolls: Off the Record, the film aired on PBS's Great Performances series in December 1992, and was released on DVD in 2007. Complete takes of most of the show's songs are featured, as well as coaching from director Zaks, and commentary sessions by stars Gallagher, de Guzman, Lane and Prince on the production and their characters.  Lorna Luft auditioned for the role of Adelaide in this production. Faith Prince ultimately played the role, and Luft later played the role in the 1992 National Tour.  1996 London revival Richard Eyre repeated his 1982 success with another National Theatre revival of the show, this time in a limited run. It starred Henry Goodman as Nathan Detroit, Imelda Staunton returning as Adelaide, Clarke Peters returning as Sky and Joanna Riding as Sarah. Clive Rowe played Nicely-Nicely Johnson, and David Toguri returned as choreographer. The production ran from December 17, 1996, through March 29, 1997 and from July 2, 1997, to November 22, 1997. It received three Olivier Award nominations, winning one: Best Supporting Performance in a Musical went to Clive Rowe. Richard Eyre won the Critics' Circle Theatre Award for Best Director, and the production won Best Musical.  2005 West End revival The 2005 West End revival opened at London's Piccadilly Theatre in June 2005 and closed in April 2007. This revival, directed by Michael Grandage, starred Ewan McGregor  as Sky, Jenna Russell as Sarah, Jane Krakowski as Adelaide, and Douglas Hodge as Nathan Detroit. During the run, Nigel Harman, Adam Cooper, Norman Bowman and Ben Richards took over as Sky; Kelly Price, Amy Nuttall and Lisa Stokke took over as Sarah; Sarah Lancashire, Sally Ann Triplett, Claire Sweeney, Lynsey Britton and Samantha Janus took over as Adelaide; and Nigel Lindsay, Neil Morrissey, Patrick Swayze, Alex Ferns and Don Johnson took over as Nathan Detroit. This production added the song \"Adelaide\" that Frank Loesser had written for the 1955 film adaptation. According to a September 2007 article in Playbill.com, this West End production had been scheduled to begin previews for a transfer to Broadway in February 2008, but this plan was dropped.  2009 Broadway revival A Broadway revival of the show opened on March 1, 2009, at the Nederlander Theatre. The cast included Oliver Platt as Nathan Detroit, Lauren Graham, in her Broadway debut, as Adelaide, Craig Bierko as Sky and Kate Jennings Grant as Sarah. Des McAnuff was the director, and the choreographer was Sergio Trujillo. This version of the show moved the setting from the 1950s to the 1940s and added Damon Runyon himself as a non-speaking character. The show opened to generally negative reviews. The New York Times called it \"static\" and \"uninspired\", the New York Post said, \"How can something so zippy be so tedious?\" and Time Out New York wrote, \"Few things are more enervating than watching good material deflate.\" However, the show received a highly favorable review from The New Yorker, and the producers decided to keep the show open in hopes of positive audience response. The New York Post reported on March 4 that producer Howard Panter \"[said] he'll give Guys and Dolls at least seven weeks to find an audience.\" The revival closed on June 14, 2009, after 28 previews and 113 performances.  2015 London revival A new production directed by Gordon Greenberg was originally presented at Chichester Festival Theatre in Summer 2014 before moving the Savoy Theatre on December 10, 2015, for previews with a full opening on January 6, 2016, running until March 12, 2016 (following preview runs at the Palace Theatre, Manchester and Alexandra Theatre, Birmingham in November 2015). The production starred David Haig as Nathan, Sophie Thompson as Adelaide, Jamie Parker as Sky, Siubhan Harrison as Sarah and Gavin Spokes as Nicely. The production then transferred to the Phoenix Theatre, with Oliver Tompsett as Sky, Samantha Spiro as Adelaide and Richard Kind as Nathan. On June 28, 2016, the role of Miss Adelaide was taken over by Rebel Wilson, and Nathan Detroit was played by Simon Lipkin. The production also toured around UK cities and Dublin starring Maxwell Caulfield as Nathan, Louise Dearman as Miss Adelaide, Richard Fleeshman as Sky and Anna O'Byrne as Sarah.  2017–2018 UK all-black production Talawa Theatre Company and Manchester's Royal Exchange Theatre produced the UK's first all-black Guys and Dolls in 2017. The production opened on December 2, 2017, and following an extension ran to February 27, 2018, at the Royal Exchange in Manchester. The cast included Ray Fearon as Nathan Detroit, Ashley Zhangazha as Sky Masterson, Abiona Omonua as Sarah Brown, and Lucy Vandi as Miss Adelaide.  In this production, the musical was relocated to Harlem, 1939, with the music referencing jazz, and gospel. Director Michael Buffong said, \"Pre-war Harlem was all about the hustle. The creativity of that era was born from a unique collision of talent and circumstance as people escaped the agricultural and oppressive south via the 'underground railroad' into the highly urbanised and industrialised north. Much of our popular culture, from dance to music, has its roots in that period. Our Guys and Dolls brings all of this to the fore.\"  Reviews particularly praised the music, relocation to Harlem, and sense of spectacle. Lyn Gardner in The Guardian wrote that \"the gamblers ... are a bunch of sharp-suited peacocks clad in rainbow hues.\" Ann Treneman in The Times commented, \"Whoever had the idea of moving this classic musical from one part of New York to another bit, just up the road, needs to be congratulated. This version of Frank Loesser's musical, which swirls around the lives of the petty gangsters and their 'dolls' who inhabit New York's underbelly, moves the action to Harlem at its prewar height in 1939. It is a Talawa production with an all-black cast and it is terrific from the get-go.\" Clare Brennan in The Observer stated, \"Relocated to Harlem, this fine new production of Frank Loesser's classic musical retains a threat of violence under a cartoon-bright exterior.\"  2023 London revival  A new production directed by Nicholas Hytner, choreographed by Arlene Phillips and James Cousins and designed by Bunny Christie opened at the Bridge Theatre in London from 3 March 2023, running until 31 August 2024 (after being extended from 2 September to 24 February initially, then again due to popular demand). Similar to Hytner's productions of Julius Caesar and A Midsummer Night's Dream at the Bridge, the production has an immersive in-the-round staging where audience members in the pit stand and the stage platforms rise around them involving audience participation. The cast includes Daniel Mays as Nathan Detroit, Celinde Schoenmaker as Sarah Brown, Marisha Wallace as Miss Adelaide, Andrew Richardson as Sky Masterson and Cedric Neal as Nicely Nicely Johnson. Owain Arthur took over from Mays as Nathan Detroit from 17 July to 14 October while Mays undertook filming commitments and returned to the role on 16 October with George Ioannides replacing Richardson as Sky Masterson. A new cast recording was released digitally on 29 September 2023, and will be physically released on 27 October 2023 by Broadway Records. This album features several bonus tracks including a pop remix of \"Luck Be A Lady,\" sung by Marisha Wallace which is played after the curtain call.  Other In 1985 there was an Australia production starring Anthony Warlow as Sky, Peter Adams as Nathan, and Angela Ayers as Sarah.  Also in 1985, there was a production at the Seattle Repertory Theatre starring Davis Gaines as Sky Masterson, Faith Prince as Miss Adelaide, J.K. Simmons as Lieutenant Brannigan, and Chad Henry as Rusty Charlie.  In 1995, a Las Vegas production, performed without intermission, starred Jack Jones, Maureen McGovern and Frank Gorshin.  Charles Randolph-Wright directed a production at Washington's Arena Stage, starring Maurice Hines (Nathan Detroit) and Alexandra Foucard (Adelaide), opening on December 30, 1999. The production received six Helen Hayes Award nominations. With support from Jo Sullivan Loesser, the production began a national tour in August 2001. The cast recording from this production, released in November 2001, was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Musical Show Album.  An Australian remount of the Michael Grandage West End production of Guys and Dolls opened in Melbourne, Australia on April 5, 2008. The show starred Lisa McCune, Marina Prior, Garry McDonald, Ian Stenlake, Shane Jacobson, Wayne Scott Kermond, and Magda Szubanski, and ran at the Princess Theatre. The Melbourne season closed in August 2008 and transferred to Sydney from March 13, 2009, to May 31, 2009, at the Capitol Theatre, retaining the Melbourne cast.  In August 2009, a concert version ran at The Hollywood Bowl, Hollywood, California, starring Scott Bakula (Nathan Detroit), Brian Stokes Mitchell (Sky Masterson), Ellen Greene (Miss Adelaide), Ken Page (Nicely-Nicely Johnson), Jessica Biel (Sarah Brown) and Ruth Williamson (Matilda Cartwright).  In February 2011, a co-production between Clwyd Theatr Cymru, the New Wolsey Theatre and the Salisbury Playhouse opened at Clwyd Theatr. Directed by Peter Rowe and with music direction by Greg Palmer and choreography by Francesca Jaynes, the show was performed by a cast of 22 actor-musicians, with all music played live on stage by the cast. The show also toured Cardiff, Swansea, and other Welsh cities as well as some English cities, receiving a positive review in The Guardian.  A concert performance ran at London's Cadogan Hall from 22 to 25 August 2012, featuring Dennis Waterman, Ruthie Henshall, Anna-Jane Casey, and Lance Ellington (Strictly Come Dancing), with musical director Richard Balcombe and the Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra and Choir.  In April 2014, a one-night-only performance took place at Carnegie Hall, starring Nathan Lane as Detroit (reprising the role that made him a star), Megan Mullally as Adelaide, Patrick Wilson as Sky, Sierra Boggess as Sarah, Len Cariou as Arvide, Judy Kaye as Cartwright, Christopher Fitzgerald as Benny, John Treacy Egan as Nicely, Lee Wilkof as Harry, Steve Schirripa as Jule, John Bolton as Angie the Ox and Colman Domingo as Rusty. It was directed by Jack O'Brien and featured the Orchestra of St. Luke's playing the original orchestrations.  In 2018 a semi-staged concert production at the Royal Albert Hall. London played 3 performances on 19–20 October. Directed and choreographed by Stephen Mear, the cast included Stephen Mangan (narrator), Adrian Lester (Sky Masterson), Lara Pulver (Sarah Brown), Jason Manford (Nathan Detroit), Meow Meow (Miss Adelaide), Clive Rowe (reprising his Olivier Award-winning role as Nicely Nicely Johnson), Sharon D. Clarke (General Cartwright), Joe Stilgoe (Benny Southstreet), Cory English (Rusty Charlie), and Paul Nicholas (Arvide Abernathy). Musical Director James McKeon conducted the Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra. In Broadway World, Debbie Gilpin described the production as \"one of the standout theatrical events of the year\".  In October 2022, the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. produced an all-star version of the production using Starobin's orchestrations from the 1992 revival. Among those in the cast included Steven Pasquale as Sky, his real-life wife Phillipa Soo as Sarah Brown, James Monroe Iglehart as Nathan, and Jessie Mueller as Miss Adelaide. Also in the cast were Kevin Chamberlin as Nicely Nicely, Saturday Night Live stalwart Rachel Dratch crosscast as Big Jule, Fred Applegate as Arvide Abernathy, and an uncredited Harvey Fierstein doing the prerecorded voice of Joey Biltmore. The production was directed by Marc BrunI and choreographed by Denis Jones with musical direction by Kevin Stites.  Reception The original Broadway production of Guys and Dolls opened to unanimously positive reviews, which was a relief to the cast, who had had a 41-performance pre-Broadway tryout in Philadelphia in which each of the 41 performances was different. Critics praised the musical's faithfulness to Damon Runyon's style and characterizations. Richard Watts of the New York Post wrote \"Guys and Dolls is just what it should be to celebrate the Runyon spirit...filled with the salty characters and richly original language sacred to the memory of the late Master\". William Hawkins of the New York World-Telegram & Sun stated \"It recaptures what [Runyon] knew about Broadway, that its wickedness is tinhorn, but its gallantry is as pure and young as Little Eva\". Robert Coleman of the New York Daily Mirror wrote \"We think Damon would have relished it as much as we did\".  The book and score were greatly praised as well; John Chapman, then Chief Theatre Critic, of the New York Daily News wrote \"The book is a work of easy and delightful humor. Its music and lyrics, by Frank Loesser, are so right for the show and so completely lacking in banality, that they amount to an artistic triumph\". Coleman stated \"Frank Loesser has written a score that will get a big play on the juke boxes, over the radio, and in bistros throughout the land. His lyrics are especially notable in that they help Burrows's topical gags to further the plot\". In The New York Times, Brooks Atkinson wrote \"Mr. Loesser's lyrics and songs have the same affectionate appreciation of the material as the book, which is funny without being self-conscious or mechanical\".  Multiple critics asserted that the work was of great significance to musical theatre. John McClain of the New York Journal American proclaimed \"it is the best and most exciting thing of its kind since Pal Joey. It is a triumph and a delight.\" Atkinson stated, \"we might as well admit that Guys and Dolls is a work of art. It is spontaneous and has form, style, and spirit.\" Chapman asserted, \"In all departments, Guys and Dolls is a perfect musical comedy\".  Film adaptations  On November 3, 1955 the film version of the musical was released, starring Marlon Brando as Sky, Frank Sinatra as Nathan Detroit, and Jean Simmons as Sarah, with Vivian Blaine reprising her role as Adelaide. The film was directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz and produced by Samuel Goldwyn.  Levene lost the film role of Nathan Detroit to Frank Sinatra. \"You can't have a Jew playing a Jew, it wouldn't work on screen\", producer Samuel Goldwyn argued, when explaining that he wanted Sinatra, rather than Levene, who had originated the role, even though Guys and Dolls film director Joseph L. Mankiewicz wanted Levene, the original Broadway star. Frank Loesser felt Sinatra played the part like a \"dapper Italian swinger\". Mankiewicz said \"if there could be one person in the world more miscast as Nathan Detroit than Frank Sinatra that would be Laurence Olivier and I am one of his greatest fans; the role had been written for Sam Levene who was divine in it\". Sinatra did his best to give Nathan Detroit a few stereotyped Jewish gestures and inflections, but Frank Loesser hated \"how Sinatra turned the rumpled Nathan Detroit into a smoothie. Sam Levene's husky untrained voice added to the song's charm, not to mention its believability\". Frank Loesser died in 1969, still refusing to watch the film version released in 1955.  Around the time of the film's release, American composer and lyricist Stephen Sondheim wrote film reviews for Films in Review. Sondheim (then aged 25) reviewed the film version of Guys and Dolls, and observed: \"Sinatra ambles through his role as Nathan Detroit as though he were about to laugh at the jokes in the script. He has none of the sob in the voice, and the incipient ulcer in the stomach, that the part requires and Sam Levene supplied so hilariously on the stage. Sinatra sings on pitch, but colorlessly; Levene sang off pitch, but acted while he sang. Sinatra's lackadaisical performance, his careless and left handed attempt at characterization not only harm the picture immeasurably but indicate an alarming lack of professionality.\"  Three new songs, written by Frank Loesser, were added to the film: \"Pet Me Poppa\"; \"A Woman in Love\"; and \"Adelaide\", which was written specifically for Sinatra. Five songs from the stage musical were omitted from the movie: \"A Bushel and a Peck\", \"My Time of Day\", \"I've Never Been In Love Before\", \"More I Cannot Wish You\", and \"Marry the Man Today\", although \"A Bushel and a Peck\" was later restored to the video release version.  20th Century Fox acquired the film rights to the musical in early 2013, and was said to be planning a remake. In March 2019, TriStar Pictures acquired the remake rights, with Bill Condon hired as director two years later.

    "text": "John Lilburne (c. 161429 August 1657), also known as Freeborn John, was an English political Leveller before, during and after the English Civil Wars 1642–1650. He coined the term \"freeborn rights\", defining them as rights with which every human being is born, as opposed to rights bestowed by government or human law. In his early life he was a Puritan, though towards the end of his life he became a Quaker. His works have been cited in opinions by the United States Supreme Court.  Early life John Lilburne was the son of Richard Lilburne, heir to \"a modest manorial holding\" at Thickley Punchardon near Bishop Auckland, County Durham, and his wife Margaret (d. 1619), daughter of Thomas Hixon. He was probably born in Sunderland, but the exact date of his birth is unknown; there is some dispute as to whether he was born in 1613, 1614, or 1615. His father, Richard Lilburne, was the last man in England to insist that he should be allowed to settle a legal dispute with a trial by combat until Abraham Thornton did so in 1818. John's elder brother Robert Lilburne also later became active in the Parliamentary cause but seems not to have shared John's Leveller beliefs. By his own account Lilburne received the first ten years of his education in Newcastle, almost certainly at the Royal Free Grammar School. He also had some schooling in Bishop Auckland.  In the 1630s, he was apprenticed to John Hewson, who introduced him to the Puritan physician John Bastwick, an active pamphleteer against Episcopacy who was prosecuted by Archbishop William Laud. Lilburne's connection with Bastwick, whose \"Litany\" he had a hand in printing, obliged him to flee to the Netherlands.  \"Freeborn John\" On his return from Holland, Lilburne was arrested (11 December 1637) for printing and circulating unlicensed books, particularly William Prynne's News from Ipswich, that were not licensed by the Stationers' Company. At that time all printing presses and publications were required to be licensed, and publishers were liable to the Court of High Commission.  Upon his arrest on information from a Stationers' Company informant, Lilburne was brought before the Court of Star Chamber. Instead of being charged with an offence, he was asked how he pleaded. In his examinations he refused to take the oath known as the ex officio oath (on the grounds that he was not bound to incriminate himself), and thus called into question the court's usual procedure. As he persisted in his contumacy, he was sentenced on 13 February 1638 to be fined £500, whipped, pilloried, and imprisoned till he obeyed.  On 18 April 1638, Lilburne was flogged with a three-thonged whip on his bare back, as he was dragged by his hands tied to the rear of an ox cart from Fleet Prison to the pillory at Westminster. He was then forced to stoop in the pillory, where he still managed to campaign against his censors while distributing more unlicensed literature to the crowds. He was then gagged. Finally he was taken back to the court and again imprisoned. During his imprisonment in Fleet he was cruelly treated.  While in prison, however, he managed to write and to get printed in 1638 an account of his own punishment styled The Work of the Beast, and in 1639 an apology entitled Come out of her, my people for separation from the Church of England.  Upon his release, Lilburne married Elizabeth Dewell (a London merchant's daughter) in September 1641. Lilburne's agitation continued: the same year he led a group of armed citizens against a group of Royalist officers, who retreated. That was the first in a long series of trials that lasted throughout his life for what John Lilburne called his \"freeborn rights\", including the right to hear the accusation, the right to face one's accusers, and the right to avoid self-incrimination. As a result of these trials a growing number of supporters began to call him \"Freeborn John\" and even struck a medal in his honour to that effect. It is this trial that has been cited by constitutional jurists and scholars in the United States of America as being one of the historical foundations of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. It is also cited within the 1966 majority opinion of Miranda v. Arizona by the U.S. Supreme Court.  English Civil War  In the First English Civil War he enlisted as a captain in Lord Brooke's regiment of foot in the Parliamentary army commanded by the Earl of Essex and fought at the Battle of Edgehill. He was a member of the Parliament's garrison at Brentford against Prince Rupert during the Battle of Brentford that took place on 12 November 1642 as the Royalists advanced on London and, after trying to escape by jumping in the Thames, was taken as a prisoner to Oxford. The Royalists planned to try Lilburne, as the first prominent Roundhead captured in the war, for high treason. But when Parliament threatened to execute Royalist prisoners in reprisal (see the Declaration of Lex Talionis), Lilburne was exchanged for a Royalist officer.  He then joined the Eastern Association under the command of the Earl of Manchester as a volunteer at the siege of Lincoln, and on 7 October 1643 he was commissioned as a major in Colonel King's regiment of foot. On 16 May 1644 he was transferred to Manchester's own dragoons with the rank of lieutenant-colonel.  He became friends with Oliver Cromwell, who was second in command, supporting him in his disputes with Manchester. He fought with distinction at the Battle of Marston Moor in 1644. Shortly afterwards he asked permission to attack the Royalist stronghold at Tickhill Castle, because he had heard it was willing to surrender. Manchester refused, dismissing him as a madman. Taking that as a yes, he went and took the castle without a shot being fired.  In April 1645, Lilburne resigned from the army, because he refused to sign the Presbyterian Solemn League and Covenant, on the grounds that the covenant deprived those who might swear it of freedom of religion, namely members of the parliamentary army. Lilburne argued that he had been fighting for this Liberty among others. This was practically a treaty between England and Scotland for the preservation of the reformed religion in Scotland, the reformation of religion in England and Ireland \"according to the word of God and the example of the best reformed churches\", and the \"extirpation of popery [and] prelacy\". The Scots, he maintained, were free to believe as they saw fit but not to bind anyone to the same faith if they did not share it.  The historian C.H. Firth opined that Lilburne had gained a great reputation for courage and seems to have been a good officer, but his military career was unlucky. He spent about six months in prison at Oxford, was plundered of all he had at Rupert's relief of Newark (22 March 1644), was shot through the arm at the taking of Walton Hall, near Wakefield (3 June 1644), and received very little pay. His arrears when he left the service amounted to £880. He also succeeded in quarrelling, first with Colonel King and then with the Earl of Manchester, both of whom he regarded as lukewarm, incapable, and treacherous. He did his best to get King cashiered, and was one of the authors of the charge of high treason against him, which was presented to the House of Commons by some of the committee of Lincoln in August 1644. The dispute with Manchester was due to Lilburne's summoning and capturing Tickhill Castle against Manchester's orders, and Lilburne was one of Cromwell's witnesses in his charge against Manchester.  Quarrels with William Prynne  Besides the feuds he had with officers in the army, Lilburne soon engaged in a quarrel with William Prynne.  On 7 January 1645 he addressed a letter to Prynne, attacking the intolerance of the Presbyterians, and claiming freedom of conscience and freedom of speech for the independents, Prynne, bitterly incensed, procured a vote of the Commons summoning Lilburne before the committee for examinations (17 January 1645). When he appeared (17 May 1645) the committee discharged him with a caution. A second time (18 June 1645) Prynne caused Lilburne to be brought before the same committee, on a charge of publishing unlicensed pamphlets, but he was again dismissed unpunished. Prynne vented his malice in a couple of pamphlets: A Fresh Discovery of prodigious Wandering: Stars and Firebrands, and The Liar Confounded, to which Lilburne replied in Innocency and Truth Justified (1645). Dr. John Bastwick took a minor part in the same controversy.  Agitation John Lilburne then began in earnest his campaign of agitation for freeborn rights, the rights that all Englishmen are born with, which are different from privileges bestowed by a monarch or a government. He also advocated extended suffrage, equality before the law, and religious tolerance. His enemies branded him as a Leveller but Lilburne responded that he was a \"Leveller so-called\". To him it was a pejorative label which he did not like. He called his supporters \"Agitators\". It was feared that \"Levellers\" wanted to level property rights, but Lilburne wanted to level human basic rights which he called \"freeborn rights\".  At the same time that John Lilburne began his campaign, another group led by Gerrard Winstanley styling themselves True Levellers (that became known as Diggers), advocated equality in property as well as political rights.  Putney Debates Lilburne was imprisoned from July to October 1645 for denouncing Members of Parliament who lived in comfort while the common soldiers fought and died for the Parliamentary cause. It was while he was incarcerated that he wrote his tract, England's Birthright Justified.  In July 1646, he was imprisoned in the Tower of London for denouncing his former commander the Earl of Manchester as a traitor and Royalist sympathiser. It was the campaign to free him from prison which spawned the political party called the Levellers. Lilburne called them \"Levellers so-called\" because he viewed himself as an agitator for freeborn rights.  The Levellers had a strong following in the New Model Army with whom his work was influential. When the army held the Putney Debates between 28 October and 11 November 1647, the debate centred upon a pamphlet influenced by the writings of John Lilburne called An Agreement of the People for a firm and present peace upon grounds of common right.  Written constitution Lilburne was instrumental in the writing of two more editions of this famous document. The second, An Agreement of the People of England, and the places therewith incorporated, for a secure and present peace, upon grounds of common right, freedom and safety, was presented to Parliament on 11 September 1648 after amassing signatories including about a third of all Londoners.  Following the defeat of the Royalists and the abolition of the monarchy and House of Lords, England became a commonwealth in 1649 with the regicide of Charles I. It was while he was in the Tower of London that John Lilburne, William Walwyn, Thomas Prince and Richard Overton wrote the third edition of Agreement of the People|An Agreement of the Free People of England. Tendered as a Peace-Offering to this distressed Nation. They hoped that this document would be signed like a referendum so that it would become a written constitution for the Commonwealth of England. The late United States Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black, who often cited the works of John Lilburne in his opinions, wrote in an article for Encyclopædia Britannica that he believed John Lilburne's constitutional work of 1649 was the basis for the basic rights contained in the US Constitution and Bill of Rights.  On trial for high treason When Hugh Peters visited John Lilburne in the Tower on 25 May 1649, Lilburne told him that he would rather have had seven years under the late king's rule than one under the present regime, and that in his opinion if the current regime remained as tyrannical as it was, then people would be prepared to fight for \"Prince Charles\". Three months later in Outcry of the Apprentices to the Soldiers Lilburne stated that apprentices and soldiers fought to maintain the fundamental constitution of the Commonwealth and rights of the people in their Parliaments by regulating the Crown not against the person of the King.  There had been rumours after the Broadway meeting of January 1648, that Levellers were conspiring with Royalists to overthrow the new republic. During the Oxford mutiny this was confirmed when Parliament acquired a letter from a Royalist prisoner in the Tower of London to Lord Cottington, an advisor in exile with Charles II in France, which suggested that the Royalists should finance the Levellers, as a method by which Charles could be restored to the throne. Armed with this evidence parliament published a long declaration against the Levellers and passed a motion to try Lilburne for high treason, using a court similar to that which had tried Charles I. As in the trial of the King, sentence would be passed by appointed commissioners (forty for Lilburne's trial), but unlike in the case of the King (who had no peers) a jury of 12 would decide Lilburne's guilt or innocence. The trial took place in the London Guildhall. It started on 24 October 1649, and lasted two days. When the jury found him not guilty, the public shouted their approval so loudly and for so long that it was another half hour before the proceedings could be formally closed.  Lilburne was not released immediately and was held for a further two weeks before pressure from the populace and some friends in Parliament finally secured his release. Although some members of parliament were irked at Lilburne's release, Parliament had succeeded in suppressing open Leveller dissent. The Levellers gave up all attempts to rouse the country and army to open rebellion, and started to conspire ineffectually in secret.  1649–1651 So far as politics was concerned, Lilburne for the next two years remained quiet. He was elected on 21 December 1649 a common councilman for the city of London, but on the 26th his election was declared void by Parliament, although he had taken the required oath to be faithful to the commonwealth. No disposition, however, was shown to prosecute him. On 22 December 1648 he had obtained an ordinance granting him £3,000, in compensation for his sufferings from the Star Chamber, the money being made payable from the forfeited estates of various Royalists in the county of Durham. As this source had proved insufficient, Lilburne, by the aid of Marten and Cromwell, obtained another ordinance (30 July 1650), charging the remainder of the sum on confiscated chapter-lands, and thus became owner of some of the lands of the Durham chapter.  Ever since 1644, when he found himself prevented by the monopoly of the merchant adventurers from entering the cloth trade, Lilburne had advocated the release of trade from the restrictions of chartered companies and monopolists. He now took up the case of the soap-makers, and wrote petitions for them demanding the abolition of the excise on soap, and apparently became a soap manufacturer himself. The tenants of the manor of Epworth held themselves wronged by enclosures which had taken place under the schemes for draining Hatfield Chase and the Isle of Axholme. Lilburne took up their cause, assisted by his friend, John Wildman, and headed a riot (19 October 1650), by means of which the commoners sought to obtain possession of the disputed lands. His zeal was not entirely disinterested, as he was to have two thousand acres for himself and Wildman if the claimants succeeded. John Morris, alias Poyntz, complained of being swindled out of some properties by potent enemies, with the assistance of John Browne, late clerk to the House of Lords. Lilburne, who had exerted himself on behalf of Morris as far back as 1648, now actively took up his cause again.  Much more serious in its consequences was Lilburne's adoption of the quarrel of his uncle, George Lilburne, with Sir Arthur Hesilrige. In 1649, Lilburne had published a violent attack on Hesilrige, whom he accused of obstructing the payment of the money granted him by the parliamentary ordinance of 28 December 1648. George Lilburne's quarrel with Hesilrige was caused by a dispute about the possession of certain collieries in Durham—also originally the property of Royalist delinquents— from which he had been ejected by Hesilrige in 1649. In 1651 the committee for compounding delinquents' estates had confirmed Hesilrige's decision. John Lilburne intervened with a violent attack on Hesilrige and the committee, terming them \"unjust and unworthy men, fit to be spewed out of all human society, and deserving worse than to be hanged\". He next joined with Josiah Primat—the person from whom George Lilburne asserted that he had bought the collieries—and presented to parliament, on 23 December 1651, a petition repeating; and specifying the charges against Hesilrige. Parliament thereupon appointed a committee of fifty members to examine witnesses and documents; who reported on 16 Jan. 1652, that the petition was \"false, malicious, and scandalous\". Lilburne was sentenced to pay a fine of £3,000 to the state, damages of £2,000 to Hesilrige, and £500 apiece to four members of the Committee for Compounding with Delinquents.  In addition John Lilburne was sentenced to be banished for life, and an Act of Parliament for that purpose was passed on 30 January 1652.  Exile in the Netherlands Lilburne spent his exile in the Netherlands at Bruges and elsewhere, where he published a vindication of himself, and an attack on the government. In his hostility to the army leaders Lilburne had often contrasted the present governors unfavourably with Charles I. Now he frequented the society of cavaliers of note, such Lords Hopton, Colepeper, and Percy. If he were furnished with ten thousand pounds, he undertook to overthrow Cromwell, the Parliament, and the Council of State, within six months. \"I know not,\" he was heard to say, \"why I should not vye with Cromwell, since I had once as great a power as he had, and greater too, and am as good a gentleman\". But with the exception of the Duke of Buckingham, none of the royalists placed any confidence in him.  Return, trial and imprisonment The news of the expulsion of the Rump in April 1653 excited Lilburne's hopes of returning to England. Counting on Cromwell's placid disposition, he boldly applied to him for a pass to return to England, and, when it was not granted, came over without one on 14 June. The government at once arrested him, and lodged him in Newgate, whence he continued to importune Cromwell for his protection, and to promise to live quietly if he might stay in England. His trial began at the Old Bailey on 13 July, and concluded with his acquittal on 20 August. As usual Lilburne contested every step with the greatest pertinacity. \"He performed the great feat which no one else ever achieved, of extorting from the court a copy of his indictment, in order that he might put it before counsel, and be instructed as to the objections he might take against it\". Throughout the trial popular sympathy was on his side. Petitions on his behalf were presented to parliament, so strongly worded that the petitioners were committed to prison. Crowds flocked to see him tried; threats of a rescue were freely uttered; and tickets were circulated with the legend:  The government filled London with troops, but in spite of their officers, the soldiers shouted and sounded their trumpets when they heard that Lilburne was acquitted. Such was his popularity that two medals were struck in celebration of his acquittal. The government, however, declined to leave Lilburne at large. The jurymen were summoned before the Council of State, and the Council of State was ordered to secure Lilburne. On 28 August he was transferred from Newgate Prison to the Tower of London, and the Lieutenant of the Tower was instructed by parliament to refuse obedience to any writ of habeas corpus. On 16 March 1654, the Council ordered that he should be removed to Mont Orgueil Castle, Jersey. Colonel Robert Gibbon, the governor, complained that he gave more trouble than ten cavaliers.  The Protector offered Lilburne his liberty if he declined to act against the government, but he answered that he would own no way for his liberty but the way of the law. Lilburne's health suffered from his confinement, and in 1654 his death was reported and described. His wife and father petitioned for his release, and in October 1655 he was brought back to England and lodged in Dover Castle.  Quakerism and death In 1656, he was allowed to leave Dover Castle during the daytime to visit his wife and children, who had settled in Dover. It was here that Lilburne met Luke Howard, a Quaker whose serenity impressed him and began the process of his own conversion. Lilburne declared himself a convert to the tenets of the Quakers, and announced his conversion in a letter to his wife.  General Fleetwood showed a copy of this letter to the Protector, who was at first inclined to regard it merely as a politic device to escape imprisonment. When Cromwell was convinced that Lilburne really intended to live peaceably, he released him on parole from prison, and seems to have continued till his death the pension of 40s. a week allowed him for his maintenance during his imprisonment. Later he was permitted to stay away from prison for several days at a time and took to visiting Quaker congregations in Kent.  In the summer of 1657, while visiting his wife, who was expecting their tenth child, Lilburne died at Eltham 29 August 1657, and was buried at Moorfields, \"in the new churchyard adjoining to Bedlam\".  On 21 January 1659 Elizabeth Lilburne petitioned Richard Cromwell for the discharge of the fine imposed on her husband by the act of 30 Jan. 1652, and her request was granted. Parliament on a similar petition recommended the repealing of the act, and the recommendation was carried by the restored Long Parliament on 15 August 1659.  Family Lilburne married Elizabeth, daughter of Henry Dewell. During his imprisonment in 1649 he lost two sons, but a daughter and other children survived him.  Importance Charles Harding Firth, writing in the Dictionary of National Biography, considered Lilburne's political importance easy to explain: In a revolution where others argued about the respective rights of King and Parliament, he spoke always of the rights of the people. His dauntless courage and his powers of speech made him the idol of the people. With Coke's \"Institutes\" in his hand he was willing to tackle any tribunal. He was ready to assail any abuse at any cost to himself, but his passionate egotism made him a dangerous champion, and he continually sacrificed public causes to personal resentments. It would be unjust to deny that he had a real sympathy with sufferers from oppression or misfortune; even when he was himself an exile he could interest himself in the distresses of English prisoners of war, and exert the remains of his influence to get them relieved. In his controversies he was credulous, careless about the truth of his charges, and insatiably vindictive. He attacked in turn all constituted authorities—lords, commons, council of state, and council of officers—and quarrelsome though he was, it is fair to note that he never fell out with his closer comrades, Walwyn and Overton. A life of Lilburne published in 1657 supplies this epitaph:  Images There are the following contemporary portraits of Lilburne:  an oval, by G. Glover, prefixed to 'The Christian Man's Trial.' 1641.  the same portrait republished in 1646, with prison bars across the face to represent Lilburne's imprisonment.  a full-length representing Lilburne' pleading at the bar with Coke's 'Institutes' in his hand; prefixed to 'The Trial of Lieut.-col. John Lilburne, by Theodorus Varax,' 1649.  Bibliography A bibliographical list of Lilburne's pamphlets compiled by Edward Peacock is printed in Notes and Queries for 1898. Most of them contain autobiographical matter.  Fictional portrayal Lilburne was portrayed by Tom Goodman-Hill in the 2008 television drama The Devil's Whore. In this fictional work, Lilburne is shown to have died in prison while being visited by his wife, Elizabeth. He was also played by Michael Pennington in the 1981 television play A Last Visitor for Mr. Hugh Peter, and by Gerald Kyd in the 2012 premiere of the play 55 Days.  Lt-Colonel John Lilburne has a regiment in his honour in the Sealed Knot Society (which re-enacts historical battles).  In 1997 the singer-songwriter Rev Hammer released a concept album Called \"Freeborn John\" telling John Lilburne's story. The album featured musical and vocal contributions from Maddy Prior, Rose Kemp, Eddi Reader, Rory McLeod, members of The Levellers, and Justin Sullivan alongside other members of New Model Army.

    "text": "Yu-Gi-Oh!, known in Japan as  and alternatively subtitled Rulers of the Duel in the United States and Canada, is a Japanese anime series animated by Studio Gallop based on the Yu-Gi-Oh! manga series written by Kazuki Takahashi. It is the second anime adaptation of the manga following the 1998 anime television series produced by Toei Animation. The series revolves around a young high school boy named Yugi Muto who battles opponents in the Duel Monsters card game. The series begins from chapter 60 in volume 7 before loosely adapting the remaining chapters of the original manga by making story changes that conflict with the events of the manga canon.  Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters originally aired in Japan on TV Tokyo from April 2000 to September 2004, running for 224 episodes; A remastered version, highlighting certain duels, began airing in Japan in February 2015. An English-language localization of the anime series was produced by 4Kids Entertainment, and aired in the United States from September 29, 2001, to June 10, 2006, on Kids' WB. Twelve extra episodes, which is American-produced, aired exclusively for the Western audience in mid-late 2006 shortly after the conclusion of the main series.   The series has since spawned its own metaseries. Duel Monsters would be succeeded by Yu-Gi-Oh! GX, Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's, Yu-Gi-Oh! Zexal, Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V, Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS, Yu-Gi-Oh! Sevens, and Yu-Gi-Oh! Go Rush!!. Two films based on this anime series have also been produced: Yu-Gi-Oh! The Movie: Pyramid of Light and Yu-Gi-Oh!: Bonds Beyond Time.  Plot overview  Season 1  The story follows Yugi Muto, a boy who completed an ancient Egyptian artifact known as the Millennium Puzzle, which led to him to inherit an alter-ego spirit. After defeating his rival, Seto Kaiba, in a game of Duel Monsters, Yugi is approached by Maximillion Pegasus, the creator of Duel Monsters, who uses the power of another Millennium Item, the Millennium Eye, to kidnap the soul of Yugi's grandfather. Joined by his friends Joey Wheeler (Katsuya Jonouchi), Tristan Taylor (Hiroto Honda), and Téa Gardner (Anzu Mazaki), Yugi enters Pegasus' Duelist Kingdom tournament in order to defeat Pegasus and free his grandfather's soul.  Season 2  Yugi learns that the spirit dwelling within him is a nameless Pharaoh from ancient Egyptian times, who doesn't remember anything of his past. Yugi enters Kaiba's Battle City tournament in order to obtain the three Egyptian God cards needed to unveil the Pharaoh's past. Along the way, Yugi encounters more Millennium Item wielders, including Marik Ishtar, the wielder of the Millennium Rod, and his elder sister Izhizu Ishtar who possesses the prophesying Millennium Necklace.  Season 3  The first twenty-four episodes of the season form an original story arc that sees Yugi and his friends get sucked into a virtual world run by Noah, the legitimate son of Kaiba's adoptive father, Gozaburo. After returning to the real world, the finals of the Battle City tournament commence.  Season 4  Produced during the time Millennium World was being written, in a new, original story arc, the Orichalcos drains the power from the Egyptian God cards and begins gathering souls in order to revive the ancient dragon, Leviathan. Yugi, Joey and Kaiba are each given a legendary dragon card to fight the Orichalcos and its leader, Dartz.  Season 5  The final season is equivalent to Millennium World in the manga. However, the first half focuses on anime-original story arcs released during the time the final chapters of the manga were being written.  After the Orichalcos has been eliminated, in another original story arc, Yugi and his friends battle in the KaibaCorp Grand Championship to face off another of Kaiba's rivals, Zigfried. Then, Yugi, his friends, and Solomon travel to India only to be taken to the world of Capsule Monsters.  The latter half of the season sees Ryo Bakura, the owner of the Millennium Ring, overcome by the dark spirit within the Ring. When Yugi and his friends go to Egypt, they find themselves sucked 5,000 years into the past, where Pharaoh must battle Bakura and his evil essence, Zorc the Dark One. After returning to the present day, Yugi and Pharaoh duel each other in the ultimate test.  Localization  In the 4Kids adaptation, character names, settings, and other aspects were changed. The show's visuals and sound effects were replaced, and a new music score was used. In addition to explaining these changes, 4Kids' senior vice president of digital media, Mark Kirk, also explained during an interview with Anime News Network that U.S. television broadcast laws under the FCC dictated that the \"Duel Monster\" cards in the anime were not allowed to look exactly like the real cards that are sold; otherwise, the show would legally be considered a infomercial rather than an animated television series, and thus the cost to air it during daytime hours would become exponentially higher.  Streaming In July 2009, 4Kids announced plans to release the original, Japanese version of the anime series with subtitles on their YouTube channel. However, In August 2009, these episodes were removed due to legal issues with ADK (NAS' parent company) and Shunsuke Kazama, the Japanese voice of Yugi. On July 11, 2015, the Japanese version of the series began streaming on Crunchyroll. The news came over a week after an earlier announcement that streaming of subtitled episodes of Yu-Gi-Oh! GX'' would begin on August 1, 2015.  Cast  References  External links   TV Tokyo Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters site (Japanese)  NASinc. Yu-Gi-Oh!

    "text": "Jimmy Maelen (March 26, 1940 – January 14, 1988) was an American percussionist from the 1960s to 1980s, who worked with many artists including Roxy Music, Bryan Ferry, Peter Gabriel, James Taylor, Dire Straits, Barry Manilow, Alice Cooper, Kiss, Madonna, Bryan Adams, Michael Jackson, Mick Jagger, David Bowie and John Lennon.  He also played on hit records by Bob James, Duran Duran, Carly Simon, Barbra Streisand, Yoko Ono, Meatloaf, Alice Cooper, BJ Thomas, and many others.  Barely out of junior high school, his first group was a doo-wop street corner quintet called the Velons. By the early 1960s, he had become an excellent percussionist, playing almost exclusively with Latin bands around New York.  Maelen became lead singer, percussionist and founding member of Ambergris, and played with them for a few years. For the next two or three years, he worked with several bands and did session work. By the mid 1970s, his career took off.  For most of the late 1970s into the 1980s he was one of the \"first call\" percussion players in New York City. During the golden years of the disco era he was especially successful, working with the remix team of Michael Barbiero and John Luongo and overdubbing on extended dance versions of disco classics such as Gonzales' \"I Haven't Stopped Dancin' Yet\", The Jacksons' \"Blame It on the Boogie\" and \"Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)\", Dan Hartman's \"Vertigo/Relight My Fire\", Jackie Moore's \"This Time Baby\" and many more.  He can be heard playing seven tracks of percussion on Barry Manilow's classic hit \"Copacabana\". As a percussionist, he also appeared on the album, Desire Wire, made from 1978, done by Cindy Bullens. His working relationship with Barbiero and Luongo led to a solo album for Epic/Columbia in 1980, produced by the trio and entitled Beats Workin.  Maelen's first album with Roxy Music was the critically acclaimed Avalon. He also played on the Dire Straits Brothers in Arms album, he appeared with Roxy Music at Live Aid in London. He also toured with Peter Gabriel on his first solo tour in 1977.  Maelen worked as a studio musician on Alphaville's 1986 album, Afternoons in Utopia. At the time of his death he was producing his first rock band Cherri Red, along with Gary Chester at the Edison Recording Studio in New York City. Subsequently, one of the songs \"Be With You Tonight\" which was written by John Bussi, was used in the film See You in the Morning directed by Alan J. Pakula.  Maelen died of leukemia on January 14, 1988. He was 47 years old.

    "text": "The Basilica of St. Castor ( or Kastorkirche) is the oldest church in Koblenz in the German state of Rhineland Palatinate. It is located near Deutsches Eck at the confluence of the Rhine and the Moselle. A fountain called Kastorbrunnen (\"Castor well\") was built in front of the basilica during Napoleon's invasion of Russia in 1812. Pope John Paul II raised St. Castor to a basilica minor on 30 July 1991. This church is worth seeing for the historical events that have occurred in it, its extensive Romanesque construction and its largely traditional furnishings.  Since 2002, the Basilica of St. Castor has been part of the UNESCO World Heritage cultural landscape of the Upper Middle Rhine Valley. In addition, it is a cultural property protected under the Hague Convention.  History   The church of St. Castor was built between 817 and 836 by Hetto, the Archbishop of Trier with the support of Emperor Louis the Pious, just outside the city of Confluentes (the city founded by the Romans in the area) and dedicated on 12 November 836. As Koblenz had a Frankish royal court, Louis was in charge of the construction of the church and it was built as a Carolingian proprietary church. However, Louis did not come to Koblenz until after the consecration of the church. This points to the importance of the Archbishop in the building of the church, especially as the church was until the 13th century outside the city of Koblenz.  The church honours St. Castor, who is said to have worked as a missionary on the Moselle in the 4th century and to have founded a religious community in Karden. Rizza, the alleged daughter of Louis the Pious, is venerated in the church as a saint of the city of Koblenz and her shrine still stands in the church.  In 836 the church was ordained as a Carolingian hall with a rectangular chancel, but it was extended later in the 9th century with a transept with a semicircular apse. It had become part of the monastery of St. Castor, with its priest living a monastic life.  The monastery of St. Castor was closely connected with the history of the Holy Roman Empire in the 9th century. In 842 provisions of the division of the Frankish kingdom were negotiated there by 110 representatives of the sons of Louis the Pious, Lothair I, Charles the Bald and Louis the German, resulting in the Treaty of Verdun signed in 843, which divided the Frankish Empire into three parts (West Francia, Middle Francia and  East Francia). The monastery of St. Castor became an important meeting place for emperors and kings and their descendants and place where disputes between emperors and kings were negotiated and settled. In June 860, talks took place to settle the Carolingian family's internal disputes. Negotiations at the monastery of St. Castor in 862 led to further territorial changes, which was part of the evolution of the Carolingian Empire into an Eastern and a Western Empire, from which the Holy Roman Empire (and eventually Germany) and France developed.  A cella memoriae (Latin for a small building over a grave which is dedicated to the memory of the deceased) was built in front of the choir as a chapel-like burial vault connected with the church by a circular crypt. In the 10th century, the enclosure was extended to the east as a choir in the form of a rotunda. Probably originating at the same time were the two side aisles of the nave and the lower part of the west end the building (the entrance). It was flanked by two round towers, replaced in 1103 by the two towers that exist today. The towers were originally, however, only five stories high.  In 1138, Conrad III, the first Hohenstaufen was elected by an assembly of the princes of the Holy Roman Empire at St Castor's. The reconstruction of the church to its present shape and size began about 1160 under Provost Buvo. He demolished the crypt, the choir rotunda, the apse and the burial vault and built the present east wing as a square, vaulted choir space with flanking towers, a semi-circular apse, a treasury and a sanctuary. After 1200, the two western towers were each increased by one story, to make the current seven story towers.  St. Castor's was damaged in the battle of 1199 between Otto IV and Philip of Swabia in the dry bed of the Moselle near Koblenz. Repairs were made and the nave needed to be reconstructed. The Archbishop of Trier John I inaugurated the renovated church, together with its altars on 27 July 1208. The building completed in 1208 had a flat ceiling, but by the end of the 13th century this had been replaced by a vaulted roof.  In 1110, the Archbishop of Trier, Bruno of Lauffen founded a hospital in Koblenz next to St. Castor's, one of the first institutions for nursing north of the Alps. Archbishop Theodoric of Wied in 1216 invited the Teutonic Knights to Koblenz and gave them part of the site of St. Castor's along with the hospital of St. Nicholas located there. One motivation for the establishment of the order in Koblenz was to undertake nursing at the hospital. Soon after the Deutschherrenhaus was established close by at Deutsches Eck, where the Moselle flows into the Rhine, to manage the order's Koblenz bailiwick (Ballei). The bailiwick was under the direct authority of the Grand Master. This branch of the Teutonic Order was originally called the Deutscher Ordt and later the Deutsches Eck.  In 1338, the last important meeting was held at the church. Emperor Ludwig the Bavarian and Edward III of England swore allegiance and friendship at St. Castor's.  From 1496 to 1499, vaulting was installed to replace the Romanesque roof. At the same time, two star vaults were erected in the nave and above the altar.  As a result of the secularisation of church lands agreed at the Reichsdeputationshauptschluss (\"Principal Conclusion of the Extraordinary Imperial Delegation\") of 1803, St. Castor's became a collegiate church with monastery buildings on its west facade and on its south side. Under the leadership of the Prussian inspector of buildings, Johann Claudius von Lassaulx a complete restoration of the interior began in 1830, which soon came to a standstill due to lack of money. As a result of a legacy of the dean Edmund Bausch and a gift of King Frederick William IV the restoration was carried out from 1848 to 1849.  Between 1840 and 1860, the interior was provided with frescoes. The final appearance of St. Castor's was restored between 1890 and 1894, when the entire church was provided with a veneer of tuff. At the same time, the brickwork of the south aisle was renewed.  On 6 November 1944 St. Castor's was damaged by a British air raid. In March 1945 the outer walls were also damaged by artillery. The stone material including the vault, however, remained largely intact. In 1948 enough money was raised for its reconstruction and a 25-year renovation began. Extensive renovation and restoration work was carried out on the towers in 1979 to 1990. The restoration omitted the western gallery and of the organ of 1728. A new main organ was built in the transept in 1962. A small choir organ was additionally bought in 1990 and placed below the main organ. The main organ was removed in 2013 and a new main organ is installed in 2014 on west wall above the church entry.  Pope John Paul II raised St. Castor's to a basilica minor on 30 July 1991.  Construction   The church is built as a basilica with a nave and two aisles. The narrow eastern transept towers over the aisles. The choir, which was built around 1160, with a round, three-story apse flanked on both sides by a five-story tower. The third floor of the apse is a dwarf gallery with 21 arches. Some of the columns around the windows carry a lion as a symbol of Christ.  Above the entrance is a chapel of St. Michael. A war memorial erected in 1963 in the lobby is also dedicated to St. Michael.  The steep gables of the rhomboid roof (rhombendach) on the western towers were installed at the beginning of the 13th century. Only two simply structured pilasters in the basement of the western towers date from the Carolingian period. The church including the entrance hall is 58.25 m long and its overall width is 25.3 m. The towers are 44 m high, 6 m wide and 6.8 m deep.  Forecourt   Archaeological investigations in 1990 have shown that the place has been used since the first century for religious purposes. In the La Tène period there was a hut here deepened with two fireplaces. A Gallo-Roman temple was built around 100 and stood there until the beginning of the 7th century, when a memorial was created with a Christian cemetery.  The square in front of St. Castor's has been the location since 1812 of a fountain called Kastorbrunnen, which has a humorous comment referring to the Napoleonic wars, which also affected Koblenz.

    "text": "Stéphane Marie-Eugène Reuchsel (21 July 1900 – 22 September 1988) was a French pianist, a specialist of Chopin and Liszt, organist and composer.  Biography  Born in Lyon, a descendant of an illustrious family of musicians of German origin, he was Amédée Reuchsel's (1875–1931) son. He studied piano, organ and music composition at the Conservatoire de Paris, where he won the First prize. He won the First Prize in piano at the age of 16.  After completing his studies, he was engaged as a soloist in renowned orchestras of Paris: the Concerts Colonne, Orchestre Lamoureux, Pasdeloup Orchestra. Since then, he gave numerous recitals in Europe, America and North Africa, where marshal Lyautey gave him the best reception.  After the Second World War, Reuchsel continued his international tours: West Africa, Equatorial Africa, Madagascar, Reunion Islands and Mauritius, etc. At the same time, he performed in all the major Parisian theatres: Châtelet, Édouard VII, Mogador, Théâtre des Champs-Elysées, Erard, Gaveau, Pleyel, Palais de Chaillot during the \"Grandes Nuits musicales\", etc.  Between two tours, Reuchsel used to come to his villa \"Croknotes\", built in 1927 at Rayol by architect Édouard Mas. The house, close to the sea, opens widely on this last one. One of the peculiarities of the villa is that it has an organ in the living room, with a wind tunnel in the basement. There are also two concert pianos, one of which was given at the Town Hall of Rayol-Canadel. Reuchsel also trained students, such as composer Jean-Patrick André born in 1954.  Reuchsel died in 1988. He is buried in the Rayol-Canadel cemetery.

    "text": "{{infobox RPG |title= Star Trek: Adventure Gaming in the Final Frontier |image=File:Star Trek, Adventure Gaming in the Final Frontier.jpg |caption=Cover |designer= Michael Scott |publisher= Heritage Models |date= 1978|genre= Science fiction (Star Trek) |system= Custom |footnotes= }}Star Trek: Adventure Gaming in the Final Frontier is a role-playing game set in the fictional Star Trek universe. The game was published and edited by Heritage Models from 1978 until Heritage Models dropped the Star Trek gaming license.  SettingStar Trek: Adventure Gaming in the Final Frontier is set on unexplored planets within the United Federation of Planets Starfleet. Most player characters are members of Starfleet engaged in planetary exploration missions. The game is set in the original TV series era (a.d. 2260s) and Star Trek: The Animated Series TV series.  The first Star Trek RPG license In 1978, Paramount Pictures licensed Heritage Models to produce the first official Star Trek RPG and figure line based on Star Trek: The Original Series and Star Trek: The Animated Series.  System The rules are split into a “Basic Game” using pre-generated characters from the series and an “Advanced Game” with full character creation and additional combat rules like random initiative.  The basics The basic rules includes a section on preparing to play, explanations of six characteristics, movement, hand-to-hand and ranged combat rules, sequence of play for the “action phase,” and a list of twenty personalities along with their characteristic values. It also includes brief descriptions of Star Trek equipment and an example of play.  Character generation Characters have six attributes (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Charisma, Luck, and Mentality) generated by 3d6 rolls modified by race. The rules include a hand-to-hand class bonus but no other skills or experience rules. Players resolve melee combat in a single damage step. The attacker rolls 1d6-6d6 (depending on weapon) plus Strength, Dexterity, and hand-to-hand class modifiers. The defender subtracts 1d6 plus Luck and hand-to-hand class modifiers from this total to determine damage. Ranged combat requires a 1d6 roll under a hit number which depends on range and the attacker's Dexterity.  Most humanoid characters from the original Star Trek TV series or animated series are playable character types. These include: Humans, Vulcans, Tellarites, Andorians, Orions, Klingon, Caitians, Edoans, and Romulans.  Using the basic rules, players use the pre-generated bridge crew from the show, including Captain Kirk, Mr Spock, Lieutenant Uhura, Yeoman Janice Rand, M’ress, and Arex from Paramount's Star Trek: The Animated Series.  Advanced rules About twenty pages of information charts and rule expansions allows for more advanced play. The advanced section contains rules for creating original characters, a list of lifeforms and their characteristics from the TV series, advanced combat rules, and a list of equipment.  The rules included descriptions of alien races, including Larry Niven's Kzin, an equipment list, tables for randomly generated aliens, and two introductory scenarios.  Starships The game offers no starship rules, as adventurers participate in landing party missions using rules for personal-level roleplaying.  Official rulebooks  Star Trek: Adventure Gaming in the Final Frontier (1978)  Unofficial supplements “Star Trek: Beyond the Final Frontier” was written by Paul Montgomery Crabaugh and appeared in Different Worlds #18 (the January 1982 issue) published by Chaosium, Inc. The article was seven pages in length with fifteen small tables (pages 10–16). Here is the brief editorial blurb from the beginning of the article:  “Written to supplement Star Trek: Adventure Gaming in the Final Frontier role-playing rules, this variant covers a wide range of topics including Experience, Skills, Aging, Salaries, Price Lists, The Referee’s Role, Chain of Command, and World Generation.”  The author's influences were stated up-front: Paramount's Star Trek: The Original Series, Star Trek: The Animated Series, and Franz Joseph's Star Fleet Technical Manual. Crabaugh stated that he did not use Star Trek: The Motion Picture because there was more useful gaming material available in the TV episodes and their novelizations.  Unofficial adventures “Kirk on Karit 2: A Star Trek Scenario Report” was developed by Emmet F. Milestone for use at DunDraCon IV. The intended players were a mix of “old dungeon-mates” and some non-gamer Trekkies who were interested in finding out about role-playing.  Emmet F. Milestone played the out the game scenario with miniature figures, since their visual appeal added so much vitality. He wrote: “I could only afford a couple of packages of Federation figures and an equal number of Klingons at the time, so I pulled some Star Guard miniatures from my shelves and an idea for the scenario began to crystallize. ... My attention wandered across to a horde of Dreenoi. What could be heavier than swarms of the all devouring insect warriors? I got busy writing stats.”  Emmet F. Milestone provided the details of how he constructed the scenario using an old dungeon map (not provided in the article), the Star Trek Blueprints, and the statistics he devised for the Star Guard Dreenoi.  In addition to the scenario, Emmet F. Milestone also added some romance rules.  Related materialDifferent Worlds #18 included an article under its \"Metal Marvels\" section entitled \"Star Trek Figures from Citadel\" by John T. Sapienza, Jr. This three page review included pictures of the miniatures and included a footnote by Yurek Chodak (assistant editor) stating \"We have learned that both Heritage's Star Trek: Adventure Gaming in the Final Frontier role-playing game and the Citadel line of Star Trek figures have been discontinued.\"White Dwarf #18 (April/May 1980) included an article entitled \"Star Trek- The Motion Picture: Miniature Rules and Scenarios\" by Tony Yates and Steve Jackson.  Although not directly affiliated with Heritage Model's Star Trek: Adventure Gaming in the Final Frontier, the rules, adventure, and painting guide revolved around the use of Citadel Miniatures, Ltd. Star Trek- The Motion Picture miniatures.  Reception Jerry Conner reviewed Star Trek: Adventure Gaming in the Final Frontier in The Space Gamer No. 30.

    "text": "A blanket order, blanket purchase agreement or call-off order is a purchase order which a customer places with its supplier to allow multiple delivery dates over a period of time, often negotiated to take advantage of predetermined pricing. It is normally used when there is a recurring need for expendable goods. Blanket orders are often used when a customer buys large quantities and has obtained special discounts. Based on the blanket order, sales orders ('blanket releases' or 'release orders') and invoice items can be created as needed until the contract is fulfilled, the end of the order period is reached or a pre-determined maximum order value is reached.  Benefits Issuing a blanket order allows a customer not to hold more stock than necessary at any time, and avoids the administrative expense of processing frequent purchase orders, while favoring discount pricing through volume commitments or price-breaks. On the supplier's side, a blanket order may provide the benefit of guaranteeing ongoing business and also help suppliers better predict future cash flows and orders.  A blanket order is set at a fixed priced contract for a period of time. The buyer looks for the best pricing among competing supplier bids. After the best one is chosen, the prices of goods are fixed, and also quantities of each product are given to the supplier to prepare stock for on requested delivery.  Forecasted quantity is provided by the buyer as full usage quantity recorded historically a few years or as needed for quantitative analysis. The supplier may give a condition of quantity to supply for this [contract]. For example, 80% of the forecast quantity must be bought at the end of the contract, which may be one or two years.  The blanket order will charge the delayed delivery if the supplier could not supply the products in the contract on time. Anyway, since the supplier has already kept the stock for ready delivery for the first year or agreed period, if the buyer could not fulfill the contract's conditions, such as \"must buy 80% of forecast quantity within a year,\" the contract may be extended, or the delay charge could be no more, or no other charges requested by the buyer.  Realistically, at the end of the blanket order contract, the buyer would not buy at forecasted quantity as agreed in the contract say, 80% of the demand sent to the supplier. The buyer will also allow the supplier to sell the products in the contract to reduce the quantity. The supplier also has to talk and inform the buyer about the quantities of goods kept in order that the buyer could know the status of the stock.  Before the buyer issuing the purchase order to the supplier, the buyer must ask the supplier first about stock availability to avoid the problem from no stock availability.  Libraries use the term \"blanket order\" to cover their agreements with publishers to purchase \"all of a certain set of publications\". Blanket orders or call-off orders may also be used for ordering services, for example for maintenance and repair services. In these cases, the benefits associated with stock-holding do not arise but the call-off order may allow emergency repairs or on-call maintenance to be arranged easily at guaranteed rates.  Difficulties The most difficult part of having a contract is determining the forecast quantity arranged by the user of the product. As the forecast quantity can be difficult to get, the supplier must be aware of the quantity to keep in stock. An easy way to do this is to discuss with the buyer what quantity to keep in stock. For example, they might keep only 20% in stock in the first 6 months, so that the supplier and the buyer are able to review the quantity and adjust it appropriately. This reduces the stock burden of the supplier during the contract period and might help the buyer at the end of the contract if the stock does not move as quickly as anticipated. The contract might be extended year after year, but it can be adjusted each time as more relevant forecasting history will predicate the need to decrease or increase stock requirements. Alternatively, some companies may utilize forecasted information via a material requirements planning system to determine appropriate stock quantities throughout the product's life cycle.  Federal Acquisition Regulation The United States' Federal Acquisition Regulation uses the term \"blanket purchase agreements\" or BPAs at FAR 8.405-3: The Regulation notes a preference in favour of establishing multiple-award BPAs where practicable, rather than only awarding a single-award BPA.  According to the U.S. General Services Administration, BPAs:  Provide opportunities to negotiate improved discounts  Satisfy recurring requirements  Reduce administrative costs by eliminating repetitive acquisition efforts  Permit ordering activities to leverage buying power through volume purchasing  Enable ordering activities streamlined ordering procedures  Permit ordering activities to incorporate Contractor Team Arrangements (CTAs)  Reduce procurement lead time Allow ordering activities the ability to incorporate additional agency or local terms and conditions not in conflict with the underlying contract.

    "text": "The selfish herd theory states that individuals within a population attempt to reduce their predation risk by putting other conspecifics between themselves and predators. A key element in the theory is the domain of danger, the area of ground in which every point is nearer to a particular individual than to any other individual. Such antipredator behavior inevitably results in aggregations. The theory was proposed by W. D. Hamilton in 1971 to explain the gregarious behavior of a variety of animals. It contrasted the popular hypothesis that evolution of such social behavior was based on mutual benefits to the population.  The basic principle governing selfish herd theory is that in aggregations, predation risk is greatest on the periphery and decreases toward the center. More dominant animals within the population are proposed to obtain low-risk central positions, whereas subordinate animals are forced into higher risk positions. The hypothesis has been used to explain why populations at higher predation risk often form larger, more compact groups. It may also explain why these aggregations are often sorted by phenotypic characteristics such as strength.  Hamilton's selfish herd  W. D. Hamilton proposed the theory in an article titled \"Geometry for the Selfish Herd\". To date, this article has been cited in over 2000 sources. To illustrate his theory, Hamilton asked readers to imagine a circular lily pond which sheltered a population of frogs and a water snake. Upon seeing the water snake, the frogs scatter to the rim of the pond, and the water snake attacks the nearest one. Hamilton proposed that in this model, each frog had a better chance of not being closest to, and thus vulnerable to attack by, the water snake if he was between other frogs. As a result, modeled frogs jumped to smaller gaps between neighboring frogs.  Domain of danger This simple example was based on what Hamilton identified as each frog's domain of danger, the area of ground in which any point was nearer to that individual than it was to any other individual. The model assumed that frogs were attacked from random points and that if an attack was initiated from within an individual's domain of danger, he would be attacked and likely killed.  The risk of predation to each individual was, therefore, correlated to the size of his domain of danger. Frog jumping in response to the water snake was an attempt to lower the domain of danger.  Hamilton also went on to model predation in two-dimensions, using a lion as an example. Movements that Hamilton proposed would lower an individual's domain of danger were largely based on the theory of marginal predation. This theory states that predators attack the closest prey, who are typically on the outside of an aggregation. From this, Hamilton suggested that in the face of predation, there should be a strong movement of individuals toward the center of an aggregation.  A domain of danger may be measured by constructing a Voronoi diagram around the group members. Such construction forms a series of convex polygons surrounding each individual in which all points within the polygon are closer to that individual than to any other.  Movement rules Movements toward the center of an aggregation are based upon a variety of movement rules that range in complexity. Identifying these rules has been considered the \"dilemma of the selfish herd\". The main issue is that movement rules that are easy to follow are often unsuccessful in forming compact aggregations, and those that do form such aggregations are often considered too complex to be biologically relevant. Viscido, Miller, and Wethey identified three factors that govern good movement rules. According to such factors, a plausible movement rule should be statistically likely to benefit its followers, should be likely to fit the capabilities of an animal, and should result in a compact aggregation with desired central movement. Identified movement rules include:  Nearest Neighbor Rule This rule states that individuals within a population move towards their nearest neighbor. It is the mechanism originally proposed by Hamilton. This rule, however, may not be beneficial in small aggregations, where moving toward nearest neighbor does not necessarily correlate to movement from the periphery.  Time Minimization Rule This rule states that individuals within a population move toward their nearest neighbor in time. This rule has gained popularity as it considers the biological constraints of an animal, as well as its orientation in space.  Local Crowded Horizon Rule This rule states that individuals within a population consider the location of many, if not all, other members within the population in guiding their movements.  Research has revealed a variety of factors that may influence chosen movement rules. These factors include initial spatial position, population density, attack strategy of the predator, and vigilance. Individuals holding initially central positions are more likely to be successful at remaining in the center. Simpler movement strategies may be sufficient for low density populations and fast-acting predators, but at higher densities and with slower predators, more complex strategies may be needed. Lastly, less vigilant members of a herd are often less likely to obtain smaller domains of danger as they begin movement later.  Escape-route strategies The selfish herd theory may also be applied to the group escape of prey in which the safest position, relative to predation risk, is not the central position, but rather the front of the herd. The theory may be useful in explaining the escape strategy chosen by a herd leader. Members at the back of the herd have the greatest domain of danger and suffer the highest predation risk. These slow members must choose whether to stay in the herd, and thus be the most likely targets, or whether to desert the herd, and signal their vulnerability. The latter may entice the pursuit of the predator to this sole individual. In light of this, the decision of the escape route by the front members of the herd may be greatly affected by actions of the slowest members. If the leader chooses an escape strategy that promotes the dispersal of the slowest member of the herd, he may endanger himself—causing dissipation of his protective buffer. Five types of herd leadership have been proposed based on the decisions of the leader:   Seemingly cooperative leadership: route chosen by the leader happens to be beneficial to the entire herd  Openly selfish leadership: route chosen by the leader minimizes their predation risk, but does not minimize the total predation risk of the herd  Seemingly altruistic leadership: route chosen by the leader may be favorable to the majority of the herd, but may be difficult for the fastest members  Seemingly populist leadership: route chosen by the leader is easier for the slowest members to follow, but may be harder for other members  Apparently spiteful leadership: route chosen by the leader is difficult for all to follow, but is nearly impossible for the slowest members to follow  Although some types of escape are seemingly altruistic, they promote the stability of the herd, and thus decrease the predation risk of the leader. This choice is often affected by the terrain of the area.  Evolution Gregarious behavior occurs in a wide variety of taxa and thus, has likely evolved independently on several occasions.  Dilution of predation risk is one of many proposed benefits that have facilitated the selection of such behavior. Much research has been devoted to understanding the possible evolution of the selfish herd and thus, the plausibility of the theory. In order for the selfish herd to have evolved, movement rules that decreased domains of danger within a population must have been selected. Because such rules are often complex, it is unlikely that they would have evolved in a single step. Rather, simple rules that considered solely the nearest neighbor in guiding movement may have given rise to the evolution of more complicated rules. This proposed succession would only occur if individuals who moved toward their nearest neighbor in the face of predation showed a higher survival than those who did not. Furthermore, individuals must have benefited from such movements more often than they were harmed (i.e. forced onto the periphery and attacked). This idea has, in fact, gained support. A study conducted by Reluga and Viscido found that natural selection of localized movement rules of members within a population could, in fact, promote the evolution of the selfish herd. Further, it has been shown that how the predator attacks plays a crucial role in whether or not selfish herd behavior can evolve.  Trade-offs Although the selfish herd promotes decreased predation risk to many of its members, a variety of risks have been associated with such aggregations. Groupings may make prey more conspicuous to predators and may increase intraspecific competition. Furthermore, individuals in the desired central positions may have lower feeding rates and may be less vigilant.  Examples  An extensively studied example is the fiddler crab. When exposed to a predator, fiddler crabs move in ways that are consistent with the selfish herd theory. Dispersed groups are more likely to form an aggregate when subjected to danger and crabs attempt to run toward the center of a forming group.  Selfish herd behavior is seen also in:   Fish, such as minnows, school to reduce predation risk.  Adelie penguins frequently wait to jump into the water until they have formed an aggregate to protect themselves from seal predation.  Redshanks in widely spaced groupings are 35% more likely to be targeted by sparrowhawk predators.  Mammals that inhabit open plains typically form aggregations likely to be associated with reduced predation risk.  Sheep move to the centre of the herd upon the presence of a predator.  Gregarious caterpillars, such as of the forest tent moth, always forage in groups to reduce predation risk.  Limitations  Although the selfish herd theory is widely accepted, it has been deemed implausible in certain situations. It may not fully account for aggregations in 3-dimensional space, in which predatory attacks may come from above or below. This means that the grouping behavior of flying birds and some aquatic animals is unlikely to be explained by the selfish herd theory. The theory may require complex movement rules that are too difficult for an animal to follow. Other mechanisms have been proposed to better explain the grouping behavior of animals, such as the confusion hypothesis. Research has indicated that this hypothesis is more likely in small groups (2-7 members), however, and that further increasing group size has little effect.  References  Ethology"

    "text": "Charles Patrick Mulgrew (born 6 March 1986) is a Scottish former professional footballer who played as a centre-back.  Mulgrew began his career at Celtic, during which time he spent time on loan at Dundee United. He then played for Wolverhampton Wanderers, Southend United on loan and Aberdeen. He returned for a second spell with Celtic in 2010, spending six years at the club. In August 2016, Mulgrew left Celtic to join Blackburn Rovers. He played on loan for Wigan Athletic during the 2019–20 season, returning to Blackburn in January 2020, then spending the following season on loan at Fleetwood Town. He signed for Dundee United for a second time in June 2021. Mulgrew made 44 international appearances for Scotland between 2012 and 2019.  Early life Mulgrew grew up in Kirkintilloch and attended Holy Family Trinity Primary School and St Ninian's High School in the East Dunbartonshire town.  Club career  Celtic Having progressed through Celtic's youth system alongside Aiden McGeady, Mulgrew turned professional in July 2002. Originally playing at centre back, he was soon encouraged to switch to left back due to the shortage of players in that position at the club. He won the Scottish Youth Cup with the club in 2004–05, beating St Mirren 2–0 at Hampden Park.  Dundee United In order for him to gain competitive experience, in January 2006 Mulgrew was loaned out to fellow SPL side Dundee United for the remainder of the 2005–06 season. A successful spell at Tannadice saw him feature regularly, scoring twice (both free kicks) in 14 appearances and being named SPL Young Player of the Month for February. He then returned to Celtic hoping to force his way into first team contention, but was transferred to Wolverhampton Wanderers shortly thereafter without ever appearing for the Celtic first team.  Wolverhampton Wanderers Mulgrew joined Wolves in part exchange for left back Lee Naylor on 23 August 2006. He made his debut for the club on 10 September in a 1–0 win at Leeds United. However, injury kept him out of most of the campaign and he was unable to force his way back into first team contention afterwards.  Southend United Mulgrew was loaned out to English League One side Southend United at the end of the January transfer window for the remainder of the 2007–08 season, which saw the club lose in the play-offs to Doncaster Rovers. He scored his only goal for the club against Carlisle United.  Aberdeen Mulgrew was due to join Swindon Town in July 2008 for a fee of approximately £150,000, but pulled out of the move. He eventually left for Aberdeen on 15 July 2008, where he signed a two-year deal, moving for an undisclosed fee.  Mulgrew scored the only goal against Motherwell at Fir Park on 16 August 2008 with a left-footed free kick, in his second competitive match for Aberdeen. He scored two goals, a volley and a free kick, against Celtic in a 3–2 defeat on 27 September 2008.  On 16 May 2009, during the penultimate league match of the 2008–09 season at Ibrox Stadium against Rangers, Mulgrew and Rangers' Kyle Lafferty were at the centre of controversy. As Mulgrew made a clearance from his own half, Lafferty made a sliding tackle on him. Both players squared up to each other and Lafferty fell to the ground clutching his face as though he had been headbutted. Referee Stuart Dougal sent Mulgrew off for violent conduct, but television pictures clearly showed that Mulgrew had not made clear contact with Lafferty. Lafferty was seen to wink to a teammate after Mulgrew had left the field. Mulgrew later had his red card rescinded and Lafferty was given a two-month suspension.  In October 2009, Mulgrew was offered a new contract by Aberdeen, but he rejected the deal and left the club at the end of the 2009–10 season. In 83 games for the Dons, Mulgrew scored ten goals, including a string of free kicks.  Return to Celtic  On 1 July 2010, Mulgrew returned to Celtic on a three-year deal, becoming new manager Neil Lennon's first signing. On 2 January 2011, having played only a handful of games, he played against Rangers in a 2–0 win at Ibrox on the left wing. On 29 January, he deputised for Daniel Majstorović at centre back against former team Aberdeen in a 4–1 League Cup semi-final win at Hampden Park. He scored his first goal for Celtic in that game, nodding home Kris Commons' corner from close range. Mulgrew became a regular in the centre of defence alongside Majstorović. In the Scottish Cup semi-final on 17 April, he scored his second goal for Celtic from a long-range free kick; like his first goal, it was at Hampden Park and against Aberdeen. On 21 May 2011, Mulgrew kept up the trend of scoring at Hampden by netting in the final against Motherwell. He scored the final goal of Celtic's 3–0 win with a free kick into the top corner, and helped earn him his first medal in football.  On 25 August 2011, Mulgrew continued his set piece record by scoring a free kick in Celtic's 1–3 defeat to Sion in their second leg UEFA Europa League qualifier. The following day, Mulgrew signed a contract extension at Celtic to keep him at the club until at least 2015.  On 17 September 2011 he was sent off against Rangers for a second bookable offence, a challenge on Steven Davis. Mulgrew scored his first SPL goal for Celtic on 15 October 2011, a headed equaliser at Rugby Park as Celtic came back from 3–0 down to draw 3–3 with Kilmarnock. On 7 April 2012, Celtic beat Kilmarnock at Rugby Park to confirm them as Scottish Premier League champions. Mulgrew scored two and set up two in the 6–0 win. On 29 April 2012, he scored Celtic's first goal in a 3–0 victory over Rangers. His performances won him the SPL, Players' and writers' player of the year awards for 2011–12. He also picked up Celtic's Player of the Year and Player's Player of the Year awards.  On 21 July 2012 Mulgrew was sent off for a deliberate handball in a pre-season friendly against Ajax at the Amsterdam ArenA. As a result, he missed Celtic's opening 2012–13 SPL game with his former club Aberdeen.  On 1 August 2012, Mulgrew scored the winning goal in Celtic's 2–1 victory against HJK Helsinki in the first leg of the Champions League Third Qualifying Round.  His contract with Celtic expired at the end of the 2015–16 season. Mulgrew was offered the use of Celtic's training facilities during the early part of the 2016–17 season.  Blackburn Rovers  2016–17 On 31 August 2016, Mulgrew signed for Blackburn Rovers on a three-year contract. He scored his first goal for Blackburn in a 1–0 away win against Newcastle United on 26 November 2016 and later scored a free-kick against them in another 1–0 victory in the reverse fixture on 2 January 2017. He made 30 appearances and scored three times in his first season in the club, but they were relegated to League One. Following this, the Lancashire Telegraph reported that Middlesbrough and Hull City were interested in signing him.  2017–18 In July 2017, Blackburn rejected a bid of £200,000 by Sheffield Wednesday. On 24 April 2018, Mulgrew scored the only goal of the game at Doncaster Rovers, which secured promotion back to the Championship. It was his 14th goal of the season, which set a new club record for a defender.  2019–20 On 8 August 2019, Mulgrew signed for Wigan Athletic on a season-long loan deal; The transfer deadline day move almost failed to happen after Mulgrew struggled to find Wigan's Euxton training ground to complete the paperwork in time. During January 2020 Mulgrew opted to end the loan.  2020–21 On 16 October 2020, Mulgrew signed for Fleetwood Town on a season-long loan deal. He scored his first goal for Fleetwood in a 5-1 win against Plymouth Argyle on 21 November 2020. Mulgrew's departure from Rovers was announced at the end of the 2020–21 season.  Dundee United On 16 June 2021, Mulgrew agreed a two-year deal to return to former loan club Dundee United.  Mulgrew announced his retirement from playing in September 2023.  International career Mulgrew has represented Scotland at all levels up to and including senior international level.  In June 2011, Mulgrew stated that he would consider playing for the United States, whom he was qualified to play for due to an American-born grandmother, if he was continually overlooked for Scotland. In February 2012, Scotland manager Craig Levein handed Mulgrew his first call-up to the senior squad, and he made his international debut on 29 February, starting at left back in a 1–1 draw with Slovenia. He also played in a 5–1 defeat to the USA in Florida in May 2012.  On 7 September 2014, as Scotland began their Euro 2016 qualification with a 2–1 defeat away to Germany, Mulgrew was sent off in stoppage time.  Following the retirement of former club teammate Scott Brown from international football in 2018, Mulgrew was chosen as the new captain of Scotland.  Personal life Mulgrew's cousin is Canadian lacrosse player Sean Greenhalgh, who plays for the Buffalo Bandits in the National Lacrosse League. Mulgrew married Alana in 2013, and they have two sons and a daughter.  In December 2010, Mulgrew and girlfriend Alana were questioned by Strathclyde Police after businesswoman Michelle Mone alerted them when she saw Mulgrew's child left alone in a car in freezing temperatures. The couple were originally charged with child neglect, although charges were later dropped due to a lack of evidence.

    "text": "Narendra Kumar Patni (9 March 1942 – 3 June 2014) was an entrepreneur and IT visionary who founded Patni Computer Systems and helped establish the overall Indian IT industry. He is considered a \"pioneer of India's information technology (IT) services revolution\" and a \"doyen of the industry\" Patni was listed in the Forbes list of India's 40 Richest in 2005.  Patni was the founder and CEO of Patni Computer Systems, (PTI, PATNI) with headquarters in Kendall Square, Cambridge and Mumbai, India. Patni Computer Systems employed 18,000 people around the world and was listed on the Bombay and New York Stock Exchanges.  Narendra Patni graduated in Electrical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee and had a master's degree in Electrical Engineering from Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He also held an MBA from the MIT Sloan School of Management.  Patni divided his time between Mumbai, India and Boston, MA.  He died on 3 June 2014 in Boston, MA.  Early life and education  Patni was born in 1942 in Delhi, India to a Jain Business family.  He attended the University of Roorkee (presently known as the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Roorkee) and graduated with a Bachelors in Electrical Engineering in 1964.  He then received a fellowship from the Grass Foundation  to study at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, MA, arriving in the US in 1964—the year before the Immigration and Naturalisation Act of 1965 started Indian emigration to the US in earnest. Patni obtained a Masters in Electrical Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (SM 1966) and an SM from the Sloan School of Management (SM 1969).  Career  At MIT Patni met Jay W. Forrester, inventor of magnetic core memory, who became his lifelong mentor. After graduating from MIT Patni joined Forrester Consulting Group, which applied \"systems analysis approach to complex corporate systems\"   In 1972, Patni was president of Forrester Consulting Group, which advised companies and government agencies on technology issues. It was at this time that Patni and his wife Poonam began to conceptualise and test the idea of \"offshoring\" technology services.  The site of their initial tests, Patni's residence at 10 St Paul Street, Cambridge, \"could qualify as a historic landmark\" as this is where Narendra and Poonam experimented with converting data from paper documents to computer databases without relying on any oral communications.  Patni was convinced of the economic impact that this business model could have and set up Data Conversion, Inc, in October 1972.  Poonam Patni based herself in Pune, India and set up a team of about 20 programmers who entered data into Flexowriter machines for early clients, who included Lexis Nexis, the American Film Institute, and the American Mathematical Society.  The paper tape was then converted into magnetic tape and entered into a computer. \"At one point of time, DCI was typesetting almost half of the journals published in north-east USA.\"  Initially, the paper tape was produced in India and shipped back to the US. A more efficient method was to avoid the paper tape and enter the data directly into computers, on magnetic media.  Patni Computer Systems was founded in 1976.  This marked the beginning of an evolution in Patni's model from offshore data conversion services to software development services. Initial clients were Data General, Raheja Constructions, and ACC.  Patni Computers also became a distributor and later licensed manufacturer of Data General computers.  In 1977, Patni appointed NR Narayana Murthy to head the software division, who eventually left Patni Computers in 1980 along with six colleagues and went on to found Infosys.  In 1999, Patni Computer Systems was restructured as a \"pure software operation\"  It became a \"separate entity from PCS Industries Limited\". In 2001 the software (PATNI) and hardware (PCS Technologies) divisions were separated entirely in branding as well.  With the Patni Computer Systems, the software company, being branded as PATNI.  General Atlantic Partners, a leading global private equity company, invested $100 million in Patni Computer Systems in 2002. It was \"one of the most substantial investments made in any Indian software company by an international private investment group and [was] the largest made by General Atlantic in Asia.\"  Patni Computers listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and National Stock Exchange of India  in January 2004.  It issued ADRs on the NYSE (ticker: PTI) in December 2005.  In 2011 software firm iGate acquired a majority stake in PCS for $1.2 billion. This deal was \"the second-largest in the high technology sector in terms of deal value, after Oracle Corp's acquisition of majority stake in India's i-flex solutions for more than $1.5 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data.\" At the time of its acquisition, Patni Computer Systems was the sixth-largest software exporter in India.  Personal life  Patni was married for 42 years to Poonam Kapur, who was born in Lucknow, India and emigrated to the US in 1972. She divides her time between Boston and Mumbai. His son Anirudh (born 1976) is a graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania. Daughter Ambika (born 1979) is a graduate of Harvard University and the London Business School.  A lover of all kinds of music, ranging from Joan Baez to jazz to classical Hindi ghazals, Patni attended the Woodstock music festival in 1969. He served on the Board of Trustees and was a significant benefactor for Siddhachalam, a major Jain ashram complex and pilgrimage point in New Jersey.  Other  Patni founded the N.K. Patni Charitable Trust in India and the Patni Family Foundation in the US.  Both are active in supporting education and medicine. In 2016, the Patni Family Foundation was a significant funder of the SRCC Children's hospital in Mumbai, India—the largest such facility in Asia.  In 2008, the Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee honoured Narendra Kumar Patni with the Distinguished Alumni Award for Corporate Development, Administration and Entrepreneurship.  He also received the Light of India Lifetime Achievement Award for Business Leadership in New York in 2012.  Narendra Patni died from complications relating to surgery on 3 June 2014.

    "text": "Matthew Spencer Petersen (born 1970) is an American attorney who served as a member of the United States Federal Election Commission. In 2017, he was nominated by President Donald Trump to be a United States district judge of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. Petersen withdrew his nomination following a confrontational exchange with Senator John Kennedy during his confirmation hearing. On August 26, 2019, Petersen announced his resignation from the FEC, effective August 31. In September 2019, Petersen joined the law firm Holtzman Vogel Josefiak Torchinsky as a partner where he practices political law.  Early life and education  Petersen was born in Torrance, California and raised in Mapleton, Utah. He received an associate degree with high honors from Utah Valley State College in 1993, then went on to graduate magna cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts in philosophy from Brigham Young University in 1996. Petersen received his Juris Doctor in 1999 from the University of Virginia School of Law, where he was a member of the Virginia Law Review.  Career  From 1999 to 2002, he practiced election and campaign finance law at Wiley Rein in Washington, D.C.  From 2002 to 2008, Petersen served in senior staff positions in both houses of Congress. From 2002 to 2005, he served as counsel to the United States House Committee on House Administration. During his tenure, he was involved in crafting the Help America Vote Act of 2002 and the House–Senate negotiations that culminated in the bill's ultimate passage.  From 2005 to 2008, he served as Republican chief counsel to the United States Senate Committee on Rules and Administration. He was chief adviser to the Republican floor manager during the Senate debate on the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007, the most recent comprehensive revision of federal lobbying and government ethics laws.  Federal Election Commission  Petersen was nominated to the Federal Election Commission by President George W. Bush on June 12, 2008, and unanimously confirmed by the United States Senate on June 24, 2008. He served as Chairman in 2010 and 2016. On December 18, 2018, he was elected Vice-Chair. On August 26, 2019, he announced his resignation, effective August 31.  Early in Petersen's tenure, the Supreme Court of the United States held in Citizens United v. FEC that the federal prohibition against corporations and labor unions making independent expenditures in connection with elections violated the free speech clause of the First Amendment. In the aftermath of that landmark opinion, Petersen and his FEC colleagues developed the legal framework that led to the advent of Super PACs and governed political speech by corporations and labor unions. He also helped draft more robust procedural protections for persons and groups involved in enforcement matters, audits, and advisory opinions.  As a Commissioner, Petersen advocated for maintaining broad protections for internet political speech. According to Petersen, the \"use of the internet as a tool for political engagement has had a democratizing effect[,] … enabl[ing] speakers with few resources to communicate to large audiences, while a seemingly infinite array of [online] resources aid the citizenry in casting informed votes.\"  During Petersen’s time on the FEC, some campaign finance reform groups criticized FEC Republicans for not being aggressive enough in enforcing campaign spending restrictions. Others praised the Republicans for their commitment to free speech and principled decision making.  On August 26, 2019, Petersen sent a letter to President Donald J. Trump announcing he would be stepping down from the FEC. In his resignation letter, Petersen said, \"I have faithfully discharged my duty to enforce the law in a manner that respects free speech rights, while also fairly interpreting the relevant statutes and regulations and providing meaningful notice to those subject to FEC jurisdiction.\" Petersen's departure from the FEC left the agency with only three commissioners; a minimum of four commissioners is necessary for the FEC to vote on enforcement actions, regulations, and advisory opinions.  Post-FEC  On September 5, 2019, the law firm of Holtzman Vogel Josefiak Torchinsky announced that Petersen would join as a partner. Petersen’s practice focuses on campaign finance, election administration, lobbying compliance, and government ethics. Petersen continues to write about and comment on election law-related issues, including the election administration challenges caused by COVID-19, and serves on the board of the Republican National Lawyers Association.  Failed nomination to district court   On September 11, 2017, President Donald Trump nominated Petersen to serve as a United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, to the seat vacated by Judge Richard W. Roberts, who assumed senior status on March 16, 2016. The American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously rated Petersen as \"Qualified\". On December 13, 2017, during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee that subsequently went viral, Senator John Neely Kennedy questioned Petersen first about his relative inexperience in courtrooms and depositions and then about his knowledge of legal procedure, asking if Petersen knew what the Daubert standard was, and what a motion in limine was. He struggled to answer.  In response to the questions on his experience and knowledge, he said:  Petersen's answers received criticism in the press and from lawmakers. The New York Times described it as one of the \"more painful Senate hearings in recent memory\". Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) complained that, of the \"basic questions of law\" Senator Kennedy asked, Petersen could not \"answer a single one\". Legal scholar Alicia Bannon blamed Petersen's answers on \"a lack of preparation and basic understanding of pretty basic legal concepts\".  Carrie Campbell Severino of National Review defended Petersen, saying that his time at the FEC gave him experience in trial-like procedures. Matthew Sanderson of The Hill argued that Kennedy's concerns were largely irrelevant to the D.C. District, and criticized Kennedy as \"bellitl[ing]\" Petersen.  Petersen withdrew his nomination on December 16, 2017. On January 3, 2018, his nomination was returned to the President under Rule XXXI, Paragraph 6 of the Standing Rules of the United States Senate.

    "text": "Gerhard Heilmann (later sometimes spelt \"Heilman\") (25 June 1859 – 26 March 1946) was a Danish artist and paleontologist who created artistic depictions of Archaeopteryx, Proavis and other early bird relatives apart from writing the 1926 book The Origin of Birds, a pioneering and influential account of bird evolution. Heilmann lacked a formal training in science although he studied medicine briefly before shifting to art. His ideas on bird evolution were first written in Danish in the Dansk Ornitologisk Tidsskrift. Heilmann received little help and often got considerable opposition from Danish professional zoologists of the time and he in turn often made dismissive remarks on the ideas of some of the established scientists of the time. The English edition however reached out to a much larger audience and influenced ideas in bird evolution for nearly half a century.  Life  Heilmann was born in Skelskør, Denmark where his father was a pharmacist. He joined a polytechnic at Roskilde in 1877 but moved to study medicine. While studying medicine he became inclined towards art and considered becoming a professional. Against the wishes of his family, he quit his medicine studies in 1883 and became an apprentice painter of Franz Schwartz and later P S Krøyer. He joined Royal Copenhagen porcelain works in 1890 and worked there until 1902. He then worked as a free-lance artist, illustrating books. Some of his key works included illustrations in Schiøler's Danmarks Fugle (birds of Denmark), Jægeren i Naturen (1925) (Hunter in Nature), Danmarks Sangfugle 1926 (Denmark's songbirds), and a three-volume Danmarks Fugleliv (1926–1930). An ardent birdwatcher himself, he was one of the first members of the Danish Ornithological Society started in 1906. He designed the front cover of the society's journal. Some Danish banknotes were designed by him.  His major work was however published as a series of short notes in Danish published in the journal Dansk Ornitologisk Forenings Tidsskrift between 1913 and 1916 and titled Vor nuværende Viden om Fuglenes Afstamning (Our present knowledge about the origin of birds). In 1926, he enlarged this and published it as an English book \"The Origin of Birds\". This was acclaimed for its bold ideas, depth of research and excellent illustration. He was largely self-taught and essentially an amateur, he was largely disregarded locally by established academics. He however was not afraid of taking on the establishment and made his arguments clear. Heilmann was considered a quarrelsome personality. He was brought up in a conservative religious family. In later life he rebelled against religion and in 1940 he wrote a book on Darwinism and devoted the last section to arguing against religious ideas (Univers og traditionen). This included a large section pointing out how angels could not have wings since they did not have the right chest musculature. Except for this part of the book, it was overall well received.  In 1942 he changed the spelling of his name to \"Heilman\", however the older spelling predominates.  The Origin of Birds  [[Image:Cranium16.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Heilmann's comparison between the skulls of Aetosaurus, Archaeopteryx and a pigeon]]  Heilmann published an English revision of his series of Danish papers in 1926 as The Origin of Birds. Like Thomas Huxley, Heilmann compared Archaeopteryx and other birds to an exhaustive list of prehistoric reptiles, and also came to the conclusion that theropod dinosaurs like Compsognathus were the most similar. However, Heilmann noted that birds possessed clavicles fused to form a bone called the furcula ('wishbone'), and while clavicles were known in more primitive reptiles, they had not yet been recognized in theropod dinosaurs. A firm believer in Dollo's Law, which states that evolution is not reversible, Heilmann could not accept that clavicles were lost in dinosaurs and re-evolved in birds, so he was forced to rule out dinosaurs as bird ancestors and ascribe all of their similarities to convergence. Heilmann stated that bird ancestors would instead be found among the more primitive 'thecodont' grade of reptiles.  Heilmann's extremely thorough approach ensured that his book became a classic in the field and its conclusions on bird origins, as with most other topics, were accepted by nearly all evolutionary biologists for the next four decades, despite the discovery of clavicles in the primitive theropod Segisaurus in 1936. Clavicles and even fully developed furculae have since been identified in numerous other non-avian dinosaurs.  In 1912 he contacted Adolf Herluf Winge at the Zoological Museum in Copenhagen. Winge had initially shown some interest in his work but was not particularly helpful. Winge's short responses to an eight-page letter of queries and ideas caused much irritation and Heilmann decided to stop writing to him. Heilmann later noted that Winge was a Lamarckist, and from that point he worked alone without communication with Danish academics. He sent a short paper in Danish in 1912 and this was accepted by the editor Otto Helms. Helms was attacked by numerous Danish academics for allowing it to be published. A letter from the Danish zoologist R. H. Stamm to Helms read: May I offer my condolences as to the latest issue? It must have been rough on you – who must know birds well, and as a medical doctor must possess some general sense of natural history – to include in the journal the dilettantish mess which occupies most of the issue. His first paper published in the Danish ornithology journal was however discovered by American paleontologist R. W. Shufeldt, who was able to make sense of it thanks to help from his Norwegian wife. This opened up Heilmann to connections outside Denmark. His work was introduced to D'Arcy Thompson by R. W. Shufeldt and this led to the two exchanging ideas on morphological evolution. His past bitter encounters with Danish academics led to Heilmann initially writing \"I wonder why Dr. R.W. Shufeldt has written to you about my work; he ought to have told you, that I am an artist and only an incipient amateur in science. This is my first work in this line.\" In the course of his interactions with Thompson, he also contributed some illustrations for use in \"On Growth and Form\".  In 1940, Heilmann published a second book on Darwinian evolution, the Univers og traditionen (Universe and Tradition, in Danish). He also expressed his sentiments against religious beliefs in this book. The bird-like dinosaur species Scansoriopteryx heilmanni'' was named in honour of Gerhard Heilmann in 2002.

    "text": "Atlantic Wall, subtitled \"The Invasion of Europe June 1944\", is a board wargame published by Simulations Publications Inc. (SPI) in 1978 that simulates Operation Overlord during World War II, when Allied forces landed on Normandy beaches and attempted to break out into open country.  Background After the United States entered World War II in 1941, Germany knew the Allies would eventually attempt a major amphibious assault somewhere along the European coast, and created a series of strong beach defenses from Norway to the French-Spanish border dubbed the Atlantic Wall. In June 1944, the Allied forces attempted to breach this wall at the Normandy beaches.  Description Atlantic Wall is a two-player (or two-team) monster wargame (having more than 1000 counters) with an enormous five-piece map. One player or team controls the Allied forces trying to land and break out into open country, and the other player or team controls the German forces trying to contain and destroy the Allies. It is a highly complex game — one reviewer estimated that the entire Campaign Game would take 100 hours to complete.  Components The game includes: five 22\" x 34\" paper hex grid maps scaled at 1 km (5/8 mi) per hex 2000 double-sided die-cut counters 32-page rulebook  scenario book  various charts and player aids  two small six-sided dice  Gameplay Atlantic Wall uses a rules system based on SPI's Wacht am Rhein published the previous year. A turn consists of the following phases:  Weather Determination Phase (for a morning turn only)   Allied Mulberry Stage (for a morning turn only)  Mutual Air Allocation Stage (for morning and night game-turns only)   Mutual Artillery Resupply Stage   Allied Player-Turn (post-invasion stage only)   Allied Parachute Drop (game-turn one only)   Allied Invasion Stage (Invasion scenarios only) Air bombardment phase First Allied sea-landing phase Second sea-landing phase Third sea-landing phase  German Player-Turn  Naval Movement Stage (afternoon game-turns only)   Game Turn Indication Stage This completes one game turn, which represents 4.5 hours in game time.  The game features ranged artillery (ie. firing more than one hex) and column shifts (ie. changes to the odds) for combined arms combat and armor superiority. Units defeated in combat may suffer dIsruption and demoralisation as well as the losses and retreats from the Wacht Am Rhien system.  In addition, the players or teams can choose to incorporate a number of optional rules: Mechanized Infantry Movement, Saturation Bombardments, Alternate Final Protective Fire, Alternate June 6 Weather, German E-Boats, and Varying Corps Attachments.  Scenarios The game comes with six shorter scenarios that use a single map, and one long scenario that uses all five maps. The shorter scenarios are:  Post-Invasion:  \"The Fall of Cherbourg\" (36 turns) \"The Caumont Gap\" (16 turns) \"Operation Epsom\" (20 turns).  Invasion:  \"Bloody Omaha\" (4 turns)  \"Gold, Juno, Sword\" (4 turns)  \"Utah Beach\" (4 game turns)  The long scenario, the Campaign Game, combines all six scenarios and in 104 turns covers the entire operation from the parachute drops and amphibious assaults of 6 June until the attempted Allied breakout into open countryside 26 days later.  Victory conditions The victory conditions for the Campaign Game are dependent on the choices made by the Allied player or team, who must secretly choose a strategic plan before the start of the game.  Publication history In 1977, SPI published the monster game Wacht am Rhein about the Battle of the Bulge, and followed this up in 1978 with the equally complex Atlantic Wall using the same rules system. The game was designed by  Joseph Balkoski, with graphic design by Redmond A. Simonsen, and was packaged in a double \"flatpack\" box. This was quickly changed to a large  \"soap box\" . The game proved popular: it rose to #5 on SPI's Top Ten Bestseller list as soon as it was published, and remained on the list for the next eight months.  After the demise of SPI, Hobby Japan acquired the game rights and published a Japanese-language edition, 大西洋の壁 (Atlantic Wall), in 1987.  In 2014, Decision Games released an updated and expanded edition titled Atlantic Wall: D-Day to Falaise.  Reception In the 1980 book The Best of Board Wargaming, Geoff Barnard liked the counters and rules but was ambivalent about the maps, saying they \"have been heavily edited, and only the most important terrain features and very few towns have been shown, so they seem rather bare.\" He also pointed out that the three invasion scenarios \"are essentially solitaire, as the German has little to do while the Allied player completes the detailed landing procedures including parachute drops, sea bombardments, commandos, DD tanks, engineering activities and infantry assaults.\" He concluded by giving the game an average \"Excitement\" grade of 60%.  In Issue 31 of the UK wargaming magazine Phoenix, Ken Walten liked the game system, saying, \"the sequence of play is readily learnt, flows easily, and is thus highly playable, whilst still remaining a highly realistic simulation.\" Given the complexity of the game and the different tactics required for each scenario, Walten recommended that players try each of the invasion scenarios first before attempting to play the Campaign game.  In The Guide to Simulations/Games for Education and Training, Richard Rydzel called this \"a very accurate simulation of the Normandy campaign.\" He found \"The short invasion scenarios are exciting but are usually just a matter of die rolling for a few hours.\" He questioned the pro-Allied tilt of the game, saying, \"The campaign is a long and tedious but fun exercise on how many different ways the German player can be beaten.\"  Other reviews and commentary Fire & Movement #14 and #65  References  Board wargames set in Modern history Simulations Publications games Wargames introduced in 1978 World War II board wargames"

    "text": "The Honorable Eric Brien Rosenbach is an American public servant and Harvard professor who served as Pentagon Chief of Staff from July 2015 to January 2017 and as Assistant Secretary of Defense for Homeland Defense and Global Security from September 2014 to September 2015. As Chief of Staff, Rosenbach assisted Secretary Ash Carter on the Department of Defense's major challenges of the time, which included increased Russian aggression, the Syrian Civil War, and North Korean missile tests.  Born in Colorado Springs, Colorado, Rosenbach received his B.A. in Political Science in 1995 from Davidson College where he participated in the Army Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC, AROTC) program. He received a Masters in Public Policy from the Harvard Kennedy School of Government in 2004 and a Juris Doctor from Georgetown University Law Center in 2007. He was a Fulbright Scholar 1995 - 1996.  Rosenbach's background is in cybersecurity, both public and private sector.  He was the first-ever DoD ‘cyber tzar’ known as the Principal Cyber Advisor to the Secretary of Defense.  From September 2011 to August 2014, he served as the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Cyber, in which role he oversaw and led the DoD's cybersecurity strategy. Rosenbach continued to oversee cybersecurity as Chief of Staff. From 2000 to 2002 he advised Tiscali, the then-largest Internet service provider in Europe, on cybersecurity as their Chief Security Officer, and prior to that, he was an Army intelligence communications officer.  Returning to Harvard Kennedy School to teach in 2007, Rosenbach was the executive director of the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs for three years before going to the DoD. He would again return to Harvard in May 2017 to become co-director of the Belfer Center with Secretary Ash Carter.  Early life  Eric Rosenbach was born at the US Air Force Academy in Colorado. His father, Dr. William E. Rosenbach, a thirty-year Air Force Veteran, served in the U.S. Air Force flying a Lockheed C-130 Hercules in the Vietnam War. A professor at the academy, Dr. Rosenbach was an influential force in Eric Rosenbach's decision to join the military through the ROTC program.  Education  Rosenbach graduated from Gettysburg Area High School in 1991 and played football and basketball while a student there.  On a ROTC scholarship at Davidson, Rosenbach was elected student body president, played quarterback for the Davidson football team, and was a ROTC battalion commander. Rosenbach got involved in Davidson's Dean Rusk International Studies Program and found public service appealing. A Davidson article quotes him as saying, “Public service motivated me. It’s a rewarding feeling to know you’re making a little bit of difference in the world. I figured that I’d be either a history or government teacher, or work in the foreign service.” The Dean Rusk program gave Rosenbach a grant to go to Vietnam - the country where his father had flown for the US Air Force and had almost been shot down. The trip inspired him to think deeply about military use of force and US foreign policy.  Upon graduation from Davidson, Rosenbach became a Fulbright Scholar and studied privatization in post-communist Bulgaria for a year. He then entered the US Army as an intelligence officer in the Army (see early career).  Rosenbach attended Harvard Kennedy School from 2002 to 2004 and received a Masters in Public Policy. He was HKS professors Richard A Clarke and Graham Allison's Graduate Assistant; they both have been great mentors to him. Upon graduating he enrolled into the Georgetown University Law Center and obtained a Juris Doctor in 2007.  Rosenbach learned German at the Volkshochschule Rosenheim in Germany.  Career  Rosenbach served as the commander of a communications intelligence unit in the US Army for four years, 1996–2000. The unit, which worked closely with the National Security Agency,  provided strategic information to support US operations in Bosnia and Kosovo. The Central Intelligence Agency named it the top intelligence organization in the U.S. military for two consecutive years.  In 2000 Rosenbach left the Army with the rank of captain. He became the chief security officer for Tiscali, an internet telecommunication company that was then the largest Internet service provider in Europe. For two years he was responsible for their cybersecurity. He recollects, “It was such a different environment from the army. I had a fancy company car and flew all over Europe. But then 9/11 happened, and that really jarred me. I realized what I was doing didn’t feel rewarding, and went back to school intent on doing something in the public sector.”  After graduating from HKS in 2004, Rosenbach worked on the core staff of John Kerry's 2004 Presidential Campaign for Kerry's security advisors Rand Beers and Susan Rice.  Rosenbach served as a professional staff member for the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, US Senate. In that role he led the investigation into whether there were ties between Al-Qaeda and Saddam Hussein in the 9/11 attacks. He also had oversight of the US’ counterterrorism profile and the individual agencies’ counterterrorism operations (including the CIA and NSA).  Concurrently (2005 - 2007), Rosenbach advised Senator Chuck Hagel as his National Security Advisor.  The Department of Defense  Rosenbach became the second ever Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Cyber in September 2011. In that position he was responsible for creating and implementing DoD's strategy for US operations in cyberspace. He co-authored Presidential Policy Directive 20, which established principles and processes for US cyber operations and was signed by President Barack Obama in 2012. He also helped design and establish the mission force of the US Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM).  In September 2014, Rosenbach was confirmed by the US Senate as Assistant Secretary of Defense for Homeland Defense and Global Security. In that role he led the DoD's efforts to deter Chinese theft of American intellectual property and to counter Iranian and North Korean cyber attacks against US critical infrastructure. He also dealt with the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, space operations, and antiterrorism. He helped lead the implementation of the Global Health Security Agenda with a stress on multi-sector approaches to combating global health threats. Rosenbach led the DoD's domestic response to the Ebola outbreak in 2014 and established new medical safety policies.  Rosenbach became Pentagon Chief of Staff in July 2015. As Chief of Staff, Rosenbach was a senior leader of the Department of Defense, an organization with a yearly budget of $550 billion, 2.8 million personnel, and high-stakes operations across the globe.  Rosenbach and Carter's many objectives were defeating ISIL, building effective cyber strategy, and opening all combat positions to female service members. Other major priorities included counterterrorism operations, and strategies for the Asia-Pacific, Europe, and Middle East regions.  One of Rosenbach's major projects was innovation improvement at the DoD. Rosenbach's efforts included the Defense Innovation Unit Experimental (DIUx), the Defence Digital Service (a project Rosenbach conceived of and helped lead), the Silicon Valley-based Defense Innovation Unit, and the Defense Innovation Board.  Belfer Center  Rosenbach is a Senior Lecturer at the Harvard Kennedy School, where he teaches a core class on policy development and execution for master's students and classes about the nexus of emerging technology and international security.  He previously served as co-director of Harvard Kennedy School's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs. With Robby Mook and Matt Rhoades, Rosenbach founded and ran the Defending Digital Democracy Project, an initiative aiming to identify and build mitigations for cyber vulnerabilities in democratic elections.  Personal life  Rosenbach is married, has two children.  Distinctions   The Meritorious Service Medal and the Knowlton Award. The Medal is awarded for, “noncombat meritorious achievement or service that is incontestably exceptional and of magnitude that clearly places the individual above his peers”. The Award, “recognizes individuals who have contributed significantly to the promotion of Army Military Intelligence in ways that stand out in the eyes of the recipients, their superiors, subordinates, and peers[,]... demonstrate the highest standards of integrity and moral character, [and] display an outstanding degree of professional competence\".  The Director of the Central Intelligence Agency named his intelligence unit the top intelligence organization in the U.S. military for two consecutive years  In February 2015, then Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel awarded Rosenbach with The Secretary of Defense Medal for Outstanding Public Service. “Mr. Rosenbach’s professional skill, leadership, and tireless initiative resulted in major contributions to the Department's and the Nation’s cyber policy”.

    "text": "Nelsan Ellis (March 31, 1978 – July 8, 2017) was an American actor and playwright. He achieved critical acclaim for his portrayal of Lafayette Reynolds in the HBO television series True Blood (2008–2014), for which he won a Satellite Award from the International Press Academy, among other accolades. He also starred as Shinwell Johnson in Elementary from 2016 to 2017, and played a variety of guest roles in other television series, including Veronica Mars and Without a Trace.  In addition to his television work, Ellis appeared in several feature films throughout his career. He portrayed Eddie Sweat in the Disney sports drama Secretariat (2010), was Martin Luther King Jr. in Lee Daniels' The Butler (2013), and was Bobby Byrd in the 2014 James Brown biopic Get on Up. His final acting role was in True to the Game, which was released posthumously.  Early life  Ellis was born in Harvey, Illinois, near Chicago, the son of Jackie Ellis and Tommie Lee Thompson. When Ellis and his siblings were young, their mother, a single parent after her divorce, broke down after the death of her brother. Ellis and his siblings became wards of the state, and later were raised in Bessemer, Alabama, by their maternal grandmother. He was diagnosed with dyslexia in second grade.  In Alabama, Ellis attended Jess Lanier High School for a year and transferred to McAdory High School. He moved back to Illinois at age 15, where he lived with his maternal aunt. In 1997 he graduated from Thornridge High School in Dolton, Illinois.  He joined the United States Marine Corps at the age of 17, but quit not long afterward. Following this, Ellis attended Illinois State University.  In 2000, at the age of 22, he was accepted for enrollment at the Juilliard School, where he befriended Rutina Wesley, later a colleague in the series True Blood. Ellis earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from Juilliard in 2004.  Career  Ellis began his acting career in the early 2000s, with a role in the short film Lost. In 2005, he starred in the television film Warm Springs. From 2005 to 2006, he played the recurring role of Carter Howard in the television series The Inside. He followed this up with guest roles in Veronica Mars and Without a Trace, both in 2007.  In mid-2007, Ellis was cast as Lafayette Reynolds in the pilot for True Blood, as a short-order cook at Merlotte's Bar & Grill, a drug dealer, a member of Jason Stackhouse's road crew, and Tara Thornton's cousin. The pilot was shot in the early summer of 2007 and was officially ordered to series in August. Production on the series began later that fall.  In casting Lafayette Reynolds, Alan Ball had concerns because the character's homosexuality would be a dominating trait. He said \"you don't want to bring in someone who's going to play that in a phony way\". Nelsan Ellis said that it took him a few episodes to find the character. Ellis has said that he based many of Lafayette's mannerisms on his mother and his sister, and that the costuming also helped him to get into character. He told The Philadelphia Inquirer:  True Blood premiered on September 7, 2008, and concluded on August 24, 2014, comprising seven seasons and 80 episodes. In 2008, Ellis received a Satellite Award from the International Press Academy for best supporting actor in a television series for his role as Lafayette Reynolds. In 2009, he was nominated for a Scream Award for Best Supporting Actor. In 2011, he won the NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for his performance in True Blood.  Ellis also performed in several feature films; his early roles include The Express: The Ernie Davis Story (2008) and The Soloist (2009). In 2010, he portrayed Eddie Sweat in the Disney sports drama Secretariat.  In 2012, Ellis was cast as Martin Luther King Jr. in a supporting performance in Lee Daniels' The Butler. The Butler received mostly positive reviews from critics, with a 71% rating on the film critic aggregate site Rotten Tomatoes, based on 171 reviews.  The following year, Ellis joined the cast of Get on Up, a biographical drama film about the life of singer James Brown. He portrayed Bobby Byrd, Brown's longtime friend. Get on Up was met with positive reviews from critics.  From 2016 to 2017, Ellis starred as Shinwell Johnson in the TV series Elementary. His character dies near the end of Season 5. The first episode to air after Ellis' death, the season 6 premiere, ended with the screen \"In Memory of Our Friend Nelsan Ellis\". His final acting role was in True to the Game, which was released posthumously.  Death  Ellis died at the age of 39 on July 8, 2017, in Woodhull Medical Center in Brooklyn, New York. His family released a statement on July 10, 2017, saying that he had an ongoing struggle with drug and alcohol abuse. He had been reluctant to talk to anyone about his addiction because of his sense of shame. In the days prior to his death, Ellis was attempting to withdraw from alcohol on his own; he was hospitalized due to serious complications from alcohol withdrawal syndrome, which resulted in his death. Ellis was survived by his son, Breon Ellis.  Awards and nominations   While at Juilliard, Ellis wrote a semi-autobiographical play entitled Ugly, which was performed at the school and later won the Lincoln Center's Martin E. Segal Award. The play was influenced by his pregnant sister's murder at the hands of her husband.  2008 – Satellite Award from the International Press Academy for best supporting actor in a television series for his role as Lafayette Reynolds in HBO's True Blood.  2009 – NewNowNext Awards Brink of Fame: Actor award.  2009 – Ewwy Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for True Blood.  2009 – Scream Award for Best Supporting Actor for True Blood.  2011 – NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for True Blood.
